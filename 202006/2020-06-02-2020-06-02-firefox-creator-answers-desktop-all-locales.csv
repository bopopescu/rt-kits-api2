If I go to the AT&amp;T Yahoo site I can login to all three addresses without a problem. Therefore I know I have a good password and the accounts are not locked. </p><p>Last fall I lost access to all three email accounts via Thunderbird. AT&amp;T support told me I had to establish a secure 16 character password and convert to from POP3 to IMAP servers (this proved untrue as POP3 still works). After much effort I converted all three addresses to IMAP and regained access. A few months ago one of the three address suddenly would not login via Thunderbird. AT&amp;T technical support proved no help resolving this problem even after hours of telephone time. I can still reliably log into this account via AT&amp;Ts Yahoo site but not via an email client like Thunderbird or OE Express. On both clients I tried both POP3 and IMAP logins, and although both work for the other two accounts, nothing works for the one problem account. Thunderbird gives the following message when I try to log in ""Login to server <a href=""http://imap.mail.att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.mail.att.net</a> with username xxxxxx@bellsouth.net failed."". I used both the original password that works with Yahoo and the 16 character secure password, with the same result. I also checked the settings multiple times. </p><p>I tried everything I can think of without success. Any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Barryng

I'm thinking of moving to another browser if the problems aren't fixed in a few weeks. In Mac Mojave, the UI sometimes blinks and sometimes becomes black. I had to restart the app but it happened quite frequently. After updating to Catalina, all shortcuts are unusable, most right click menus are blank and even the menu bar is blank. When hovering the mouse over the menu bar, nothing displays, just blank menus. Sometimes, the app starts up with default UI although I customised it a bit. In those cases, I had to close the tab or even restart the app. </p><p>I'm getting disappointed and perhaps I'll move to another browser soon. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pentapower

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las últimas actualizaciones de Firefox, ésto ha cambiado. Tengo la versión 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquí he llegado. Tengo instalados además, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montón de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. Sí que lo veo ágil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veáis lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la página no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayoría de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas páginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son páginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya código malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesión abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histórico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. Tontería diría yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versión prehistórica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menú que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el móvil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situación cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente será Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ji.perez.marturet
