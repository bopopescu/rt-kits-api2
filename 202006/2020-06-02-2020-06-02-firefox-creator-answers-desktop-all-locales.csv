For testing, I've uploaded a folder that contain multiple MP4's to my Google Drive.  I then Share this drive with my other email.  I then want to download the content of these multiple files to a hard drive folder.  Doing this to test how Download works for Google drive. </p><p>I open my received email and see the Shared invite.  I log into my Google account and select the first file to download (using RT click and Download into a selected directory).  A Save-As folder box opens. Everything works with the file downloading ultimately as a *.mp4 file.  When I go back to the Google drive and attempt to down load a second file, I get the following pop up message... </p><pre>  - You are Not signed in  - You are signed out.  <em>Sign back in</em>, the click 'Retry'....there is a Retry box. </pre> <p>The Sign back in (in the msg) does not work, nor does the Retry box! All that happens is the box refreshes. </p><p>What I end up doing is to close the Google My drive TAB, and re-select the invite email message.  This opens a new tab again that points to my shared folder.  I then select my 2nd file,  and download..everything works.  Now when I try a 3rd file, I end up getting  the same Msg again and need to close the Tab and reload from the email the Google drive. </p><p>I have turned off any AD blocker on the Google drive.  It's almost something is in a cookie or cache.  I don't want to constantly have to reset any of these every time.  Tried once, and made no difference.  Any Idea, maybe something in the FF Settings? </p><p>What I want is to be able to repeatedly pick and download files from Google to my selected folder without having to re-select the email invite. I also notice, that on the second try, I don't get asked for my Google ID/Pass like I did the first time.  It's like I was sent to a third party site (Save-as pop up box) and cannot come back to the folder listing.  It would be nice if the Save-As location could be reused from the previous Save with a check box. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318488;1318491;1318496;1318504;,anuhea55

Y siempre ha ido fino y buen, con velocidad, sin problemas y con una experiencia superior casi siempre, al resto de navegadores. Pero desde las últimas actualizaciones de Firefox, ésto ha cambiado. Tengo la versión 76.0.1(64 bits). Y llevo mucho mucho tiempo con problemas, que me han cansado y he decidido que hasta aquí he llegado. Tengo instalados además, Chrome y Edge. Chrome me parece pesado, porque abre un montón de procesos que no pido, no necesito y me ralentizan el ordenador. Edge no me gusta. Sí que lo veo ágil y Microsoft le ha lavado la cara mucho. Pero no me gusta, y no me da confianza. Al contrario de Firefox. Pero arrastro los siguientes problemas, para que veáis lo impertinente que soy: 1. Imposibilidad de instalar complementos, como puede ser por ejemplo, el de LetyShop. 2. Muchas veces, la página no carga. Se queda en blanco, intentando acceder, pero nada. La mayoría de las ocasiones, refresco y funciona. Pero, no es lo suyo. 3. No tengo bloqueadores. No tengo anti-pops, salvo los que pueda tener por defecto Firefox. Mi antivirus tampoco los bloquea. Pero muchas páginas me dicen que no pueden abrir ventanas. Son páginas de trabajo (IBM, por ejemplo) donde no creo que haya código malicioso. Y sin embargo, algo impide que Firefox las abra. Antes, era puntual. Ahora es cansino. 4. De vez en cuando, pierdo la sesión abierta. Si. Tengo muchas ventanas. Pero me es imposible recuperarlas porque no funciona el histórico bien, no hay posibilidad de recuperarla entera, y es cansino tener que ir una a una abriendo. Y en la ayuda... bueno. Llamarle ayuda es un decir. Tontería diría yo, porque quien pone esas cosas, lo ha hecho en una versión prehistórica (no coincide a veces ni las opciones del menú que se indica...) y desde luego, no ha probado lo que predica. </p><p>Es una pena. Voy a dar un voto de confianza, porque la verdad, tanto en pc como en el móvil, siempre he usado Firefox. Pero me canso de tanto problema. Espero que esta situación cambie pronto. Mientras, voy a buscar un sustituto, que seguramente será Chrome. </p><p>Un saludo. </p>",other;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1318258;,ji.perez.marturet
