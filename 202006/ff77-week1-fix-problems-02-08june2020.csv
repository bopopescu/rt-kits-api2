1290343,2020-06-08 11:51:47 -0800,https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1290343,Resource consuming inside and outside differs significantly,"I investigated the immediate cause Firefox hangs or responses with long delay. Mostly, the immediate cause is that Firefox writes to disk a huge amount of bytes. Disk operations are slow, block calling thread (at least), and consume battery charge intensively. All this is of great importance to portable devices equipped by HDD (my case). The second bottleneck is memory page thrashing caused by excessive memory consuming and a lot of unloaded memory pages. When these two factors occur on the same disk, this doubles or triples disk response time, hanging a lot of processes in the system (including the firefox processes). This effect I observe every time when running Firefox longer one hour intensively web-surfing. I used ProcessHacker to measure memory consuming, disk and network operations in bytes.

When I attempt to login to the router, I get an error message ""Invalid username or password"". If I use Chrome version 83.0.4103.97, I am able to access the router without issue. I have tried Firefox in Safe Mode, but I still get the same error message. I have also tried resetting Firefox without any success.  I have another computer running Windows 10 with Firefox 76.0.1, so I confirmed that I could access the router with that version of Firefox and it worked fine. I updated Firefox on that machine to version 77.0.1 using the update button under Help/About and then tried connecting with the router again - it fails with the ""Invalid username or password"" error message. Again, I am able to connect using either Chrome or Edge browsers, but not with the latest version of Firefox. ",firefox-770;firefox-7701;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,en-US
