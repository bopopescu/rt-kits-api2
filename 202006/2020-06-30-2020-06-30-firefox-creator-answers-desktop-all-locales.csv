I realized it a couple days ago when tabs I sent to my Windows laptop from my Android phone did not go through. </p><p>On Friday (2 days ago) I installed <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-stash/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tab Stash</a> in my Firefox browser, to see if I liked it. It's a tab manager/offloader that works with Firefox's bookmark interface. I don't know if it caused the problem, but it roughly with the timing so I wanted to mention it. It's the only thing that has changed lately on either installation of Firefox. I have disabled the extension during all of the troubleshooting I've done. </p><p>Each device shows as signed in on my Firefox account. However, in the settings of the Android Firefox app, while it shows me as signed in to my Firefox account, most of the sync options (like whether to sync bookmarks, history, open tabs, or logins - and the ""device name"") are all grayed out. The ""sync now"" option is available, but when I press it it seems to ""sync"" for a second and nothing happens. When I disconnect and reconnect Firefox sync in Android, I get the notification on Firefox in Windows that they are connected. </p><p>Despite this, I am unable to share/send links or tabs between devices; neither device shows up as an option for the other device to send to. </p><p>Among the troubleshooting steps I've taken: logging out of both and clearing caches, uninstalling/reinstalling the Android app, disconnecting both devices (numerous times) from my Firefox account. </p><p>(As an aside, I also tried to installed Android Firefox Preview to see if that would break through, and it wasn't working either. A purple notification kept floating up from the bottom of the app (repeatedly/non-stop) saying that sync was on. This repeated notification made the app unusable because it blocked my from accessing anything else. This was among the last steps I took and all the problems existed before this and persisted after.) </p><p>I don't know how to interpret the about:sync-log information, and it seems each new text file it produces is different in some way. I'm happy to post if it will help. Thank you. </p>",firefox-770;sync;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,sync,en-US,1328530;1328533;1328534;1328547;,djr1904

I would click on my bookmarks or type in the URL and nothing would come up. It refused to even attempt to get on the page, nothing would come up. The page would be blank. My extensions weren't working, either, and some websites had logged me out. So the solution I found via Support was to do a Refresh.  </p><p>I did that and everything worked great again. My bookmarks and tabs were saved, I just had to fiddle with my extensions and theme.  </p><p>Now, only a week later, Firefox is having the same problem. Websites not loading, extensions not working. I'm using the latest version on Windows 10, so that can't be the issue. Do I just Refresh and hope it doesn't happen a third time? Doing a weekly Refresh would be such a nightmare.  </p><p>I love Firefox, especially because of the extensions, but that's the only thing I can think of that's causing this issue. I don't have that many and I don't want to get rid of them - they make using the internet bearable.  </p><p>Thanks~ </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1328532;1328548;,tasha1999
