It is also unusable, saying the application has been moved or deleted.  This has happened many times (with every update over the last few years).  Clearing the icon cache does nothing to prevent this from happening in the future. </p><p>It is not difficult to restore the taskbar icon.  The blank page icon must be deleted, and then I must navigate to the location of the Mozilla Firefox folder under Program Files (x86).  There I can find the firefox.exe file and pin a new shortcut to the taskbar.  Everything will then work fine until the next Firefox update. </p><p>Is there something about the update process that recreates the firefox.exe file making it break the pinned taskbar icon?  Does anyone else share this repeated problem? I have no idea if there's a way to change the update process so it does not happen, but I appreciate any information.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-770;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",alan.schano

What I need from them is to behave the way it will be most practical for me, which isn't necessarily aligned with the majority of users. </p><p>My current problem is this. I work with APIs which in my daily work often return various HTTP errors. These errors also contain a payload which describes the problem in detail. I want to be able to see this payload easily in the browser. Yes, I can use other tools like Postman for this (which I do), but for simple GET requests without special request headers it would be much more practical to just use a browser. </p><p>Currently, when my API opens an error (for example a 400 Bad Request), Firefox decides to just silently go back into the previous page (undos the URL change). If I open the Network tab in the Web Developer view, I can however see the failing response with all of its details. Still, this is too impractical for me. </p><p>BTW, the response contains a custom Content-Type which isn't recognized by Firefox by default. But Firefox isn't downloading the payload as a file (like it would usually do for a successful page load of an unknown Content-Type), it just silently doesn't do anything. I've installed an extension to handle my custom Content-Types (called ""Open in Browser""), but since Firefox isn't attempting to open this one, I can't use it in this case. </p><p>So, how can I force Firefox to stay on that URL and show the response payload in the window? If not in vanilla Firefox, any plugins? I've already kind of spent too much time on this for my liking. :/ </p>",customize;desktop;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",marko.vodanovic

During the meeting, when I navigate to other windows, there's small a FireFox window that allows me to navigate back to the meeting, and is shown on top of all other windows. So far so good.  The problem is that meetings end, I close the meeting windows, but this small Windows stay on top, cannot be closed, clicking on it does nothing.  I can just move it right and left. How can I get rid of it when there's no meeting? Thanks </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1319028;1319035;1319040;1319043;1319131;1319132;,utidhar
