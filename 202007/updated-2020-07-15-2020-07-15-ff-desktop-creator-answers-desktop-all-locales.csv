So if I want to find in history how I got to some page (e.g. see preceding pages by time) - I can't.  So basically, history is not preserving history. Any way to avoid this behaviour?

If I click this option, it puts @google at the beginning of the bar, and search works just fine. But this extra step is irritating, and it doesn't work to take me directly to a website. For example to get to Pinterest, instead of typing <a href=""http://pinterest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pinterest.com</a> in the bar and going directly there, I have to type ""@google pinterest"", and click on the first search result.  </p><p>I read some past topics addressing this question, and have tried clearing my cache, refreshing Firefox, and restarting Firefox in SafeMode. None of these have helped (and even in SafeMode I still had the same problem).
