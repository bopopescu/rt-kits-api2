But disabling all extensions and plugins in a normal window doesn't solve it. (I believe I understand private windows to use the RAM for caching but use the HDD under normal circumstances?) - Enabling/disabling VPN makes no difference, nor does what network I'm on, and other devices on this network have no similar issues - Other browsers on the same computer have no issues  - Malware, anti-virus, etc all are active and scan has been run a few times.  - Apple's hardware diagnostic turns up no issues, and this has happened now in FF over multiple of the latest versions (not sure when exactly it started) on two different Macbooks, though the new one is from an image of the old one (maybe that's something?) - Uninstalling/reinstalling FF does not make a difference  </p><p><strong>Where I'm at:</strong> The only thing that sort of worked (But it's now stopped working on certain sites, but continues to work for others) is moving FF's profile folder, uninstalling, and reinstalling. I was lead to believe FF would then create a new folder when this happened, but it just kicked up an error for me and wouldn't start. When I moved the old profile folder back and started up the freshly installed version with the old profile folder, the problems were all solved. Though as mentioned, they are starting to happen again on some of the sites. No errors or changes have been made that I can identify, plenty of space available on the HDD, etc.  </p><p>I've become a big fan of FF over the years (over Chrome), and want to stay in a privacy-focused browser, but I haven't been able to find much that seems to help this specific situation online. Any help is appreciated! </p>",firefox-770;desktop;fix-problems;mac-os;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alex144

I have just been updated to version <strong>78.0.1 (64-bit)</strong> I have a large number of .lnk files that drive my work. As of this update, Firefox no longer opens these files, instead it forces me to download the link file, and then click on the downloaded link file to instatiate it. Of course, this means that I cannot open the link file in Private mode. This is cluttering up my download folder, forcing the web page referenced into non-private mode, and causing cascading problems from there. What is the setting that will allow me to click on my bookmarked .lnk files (which in most cases open .html web pages) and open directly. If I can't do this then I'll have to migrate away from Firefox, which I absolutely do not want to do. </p><p>Thank you.

Whenever I need to restart my computer, I close my session, restart, reopen Firefox and it loads my entire session no problem. The neat thing about this is that when I do this, the tab title (along with the website icon) is preserved but the actual page only reloads when I switch to that tab. For example, imagine I have a YouTube video titled ""Programming in Python"", the tab would say ""Programming in Python - YouTube"" with the YouTube logo to the left of the title. There is definitely some kind of cache magic going on because say if that video was taken down on YouTube, the title would still be preserved until I switch to that tab. In my latest reloaded session, I noticed that tabs #250-500 failed to load the tab title and instead show the website URL with the icon I attached below. Is there any way to reload these tab titles without actually refreshing the page manually one by one (kinda like how Firefox does it on startup)? This is kinda how I navigate and it isn't helpful seeing just a URL. </p>",firefox-690;tabs;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1329407;1329408;,k2.t.cho

I can get it to work on my cell phone, Windows Explorer also.This link is very important to me. I have searched to no end to see if it was blocked. Is it safe to use Private Browser? I do not know how to setup Private Windows. What do I do to get the link working again from my Favorites bar? </p>",firefox-770;websites;desktop;windows-7;,firefox,websites,en-US,1329409;1329410;1329418;,neons
