I would click on my bookmarks or type in the URL and nothing would come up. It refused to even attempt to get on the page, nothing would come up. The page would be blank. My extensions weren't working, either, and some websites had logged me out. So the solution I found via Support was to do a Refresh.  I did that and everything worked great again. My bookmarks and tabs were saved, I just had to fiddle with my extensions and theme.  Now, only a week later, Firefox is having the same problem. Websites not loading, extensions not working. I'm using the latest version on Windows 10, so that can't be the issue. Do I just Refresh and hope it doesn't happen a third time? Doing a weekly Refresh would be such a nightmare.  I love Firefox, especially because of the extensions, but that's the only thing I can think of that's causing this issue.

My standard browsing habit consists of launching browser with 1 pinned tab and 1 home page (so 2 tabs only), then opening 5-10 tabs from my bookmarks, checking pages then closing them and leaving only 1 pinned page open. In firefox 78.0.1 after doing this (opening and then closing multiple tabs ""to the right"" using new context menu added in 78) my ram usage does not drop. It goes from 2.4GB (system only usage) to 5.0GB and does not drop after closing tabs. However when I open 10-20 tabs again RAM usage does not rise (maybe slightly, like 5.3GB). So it looks like firefox has multiple tabs stored in ram and opening new tabs just rewrites that memory instead of allocating new one. I have 8GB of ram so 3GB of usage from 1 open tab is crazy.

But notning happens. I don't see any reactions to Stop button. The only way to stop the download is to close the tab (I'm not sure, I hope it stops). By the way, it is especially ""nice"" when the program closes together with the closing of the last (as suddenly will be realized later) tab. So, there is the ""Stop/Reload"" button. Does it do something like stop something? Or it is purely decorative/irritative? Or I just press it wrong way? ",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-7;,firefox,en-US

With ~10/15 tabs open, my PC would never be troubled. The RAM usage wouldn't be at 90% but in the past few days (possibly because of a beta update?) I get 50% RAM usage (8GB) with 15 tabs. Yesterday concurrently loaded ~6 YouTube tabs caused a 90% usage from the app and I had to close it. The RAM usage might seem normal but Firefox actually never uses that much RAM - or didn't earlier at least. I used MalwareBytes a few days ago to do a malware scan and it found my PC clean.

I've had no problems until recently, but lately I've noticed that when I open a new tab, and enter either a search term or a web address in the search/address bar and hit Enter, about 1/4 to 1/3rd of the time, that tab will not respond to that input.  I hit enter, and the tab goes white. The loading bar will get to exactly halfway across the screen, and stop. Or there will be no progress bar, just the little ""loading"" animation on the tab header. Then it'll do nothing. If I open another new tab and give it the exact same input, often it'll load the requested page immediately.  I've tried running the browser in safe mode to eliminate my (few) extensions, but I can get the same behaviour. This is getting annoying enough that I've come here and written this post. If anyone can help, I'd be really grateful. Cheers, - Ed ",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,en-US
