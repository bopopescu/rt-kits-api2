Within the Windows Task Manager, I see that FF is often taking up 50%+ CPU even though I'm using fewer tabs than usual. Within `about:performance`, I see that Multi-Account Containers is the resource hog. </p><p>On another machine where I am not logged in, FF performance is pretty good. On the affected machines, Edge runs very fast with low CPU/memory use, so there's definitely an issue with FF on these machines. </p><p>About:config shows that extensions.experiments.enabled=false, and the Containers plugin hasn't been updated in 2.5 months. </p><p>I would prefer to not uninstall containers since they're so useful. I could clobber and reinstall them for testing, but is there a known issue or a quick fix for this? </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1329101;,adam.shirey+ff
