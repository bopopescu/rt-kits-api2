Posted on Community, no response. Decided to uninstall/reinstall. Now, everything is F__d'ed up. When I click on any game, all I get is a black window. Also, I've always left two tabs open and when I'm finished on-line, I would click on the red X in the upper right. Then, when I wanted to go back on line, when I click on the Firefox icon in the task bar, both tabs would come up. Now, if I click on the X, I get a warning I'm about to close two tabs. If I click OK, both tabs are closed and when I open Firefox again, they are not there. Getting sick and tired of the problems.

Synced tabs issue,"<p>I have an android phone running android 9 (Pie) and I had over 100 tabs on it open (mostly news articles and stuff). It is signed into my Firefox account. I realized that's a lot of tabs and the past 2 days I've been actually sorting them and closing some of them.
I realized I could do this on my desktop as well. Anyways my phone froze while I had Firefox open, and I realized my tabs on there were all missing... I decided not to panic yet because I could still get to them on my desktop.
Turns out when I open the ""synced tabs"" pane on my desktop which is logged into the same firefox account.. none of the 100+ tabs are there anymore either.
How do I actually contact someone that can revert my sync status or whatever to a previous state so I can get my tabs and stuff back that I had open?
Firefox crashing on my phone SHOULD NOT EVER somehow close all of those tabs on BOTH the phone and the computer.
I guess the crash of firefox somehow wiped them out, and then my desktop synced with that account, realized those tabs were ""closed"" and cleared the list there as well.

For some reason i'm a frequent user of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, and whenever i try to visit <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> i have to 
temporary unblock the blocking of <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>. This creates a lot of friction since i'm a frequent user of this url.
If i create a ublock/whitelist of domain <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> then ublock allows every tracker to load at <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a>, eg. <a href=""http://t.com"" rel=""nofollow"">t.com</a> visit triggers loading of <a href=""http://21trackers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">21trackers.com</a>.
</p><p>The idea is - Block tracking urls globally, but allow auto whitelisting of urls when visited directly.
Analogy: prevent embedded yt videos from loading in arbitrary website, but allow when you have visited  <a href=""http://125yt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">125yt.com</a>, without also allowing every other <a href=""http://21trackers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">21trackers.com</a> domains at <a href=""http://125yt.com"" rel=""nofollow"">125yt.com</a> from loading.
Sounds like containerization or ""cross-site"" url loading block.
