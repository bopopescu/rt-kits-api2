So in FF72 and all previous versions double tapping on YouTube videos switched between fullscreen and windowed modes of said videos, yet with FF73 for some reason double tapping now does fast forward/fast backwards 10 seconds actions depending on where I tap on the screen, which is something I understand is an expected behaviour on Android and other mobile oriented operating systems.
I hate it and want double tap to go to it's old functionality. Going back to FF72 does fix the problem, so the problem is not on YouTube's end. Also going back to the previous version of FF creates a whole set of annoying problems, so it's obviously not optimal.
I wonder if there is some hidden config setting introduced in FF73 that tells YouTube I'm on a tablet specifically, which was not previously shared? Any ideas?

We disabled most of the old keys and the system works fine on all browsers.
As soon as we turn off the encryption key TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014), then all web systems stop working through the Mozilla Firefox browser.
(At the same time, everything works correctly on other browsers).
The Mozilla Firefox Documentation says that this browser supports new encryption keys and can work without old encryption keys. Link (<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS)</a>.
Also on our server are included all the necessary encryption keys for Mozilla Firefox to work.

Firefox has no issue until I log into my google account, usually for youtube. The moment I do it starts a memory leak that slowly builds. Around 1.6GB is when it starts having problems that affect my computer. Restarting firefox solves this until I log back into google. I've tested for days not logging in with zero memory build up until I log in and it immediately starts to climb.

</p><p>I was using firefox with webGL until it upgraded to 73.0.1. Now all webGL content cannot be initialized. Specifically, Mapbox GL cannot initialize WebGL - I suspect someone has left a toggle in the code somewhere and it borked my workflow.
</p><p>When I start firefox with all add-ons disabled I still get the same errors. I am 99% certain this has to do with the firefox update because it forced a restart and then various mapbox gl websites stopped working - I also confirmed it was not only mapbox gl by visiting the WebGL working site here: <a href=""https://get.webgl.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://get.webgl.org/</a>
</p><p><a href=""https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/</a> gives me results in the attached images
</p><p>I literally did not change a thing except upgrade the browser as was required.

I would like to display VR videos on my desktop the same way. I want to play WebVR videos in Firefox for desktop and have the videos display as stereographic videos.
