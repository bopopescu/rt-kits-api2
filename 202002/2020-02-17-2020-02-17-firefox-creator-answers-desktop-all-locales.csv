This add on not only put tabs not in use into hibernation, but when you closed a tab it went into a recent tab list. Now Firefox browser does the same, but when the browser is closed the list is deleted, but with Tab Utilities the list remained. If there was tabs you wanted to delete you could click on it with your mouse's right button. If you wanted to pull up a tab you hit the tab with your mouse's left button and the tab would once more be on the tab work bar in the same place it was once before. In this ""recently closed"" list you could edit the amount of tabs you desired in the list and the tabs were in hibernation, as such using very little energy and little interference with speed besides freeing up your work tab bar.
The author of the add on eventually quit and the add on became incompatible after Firefox version 44 and is disabled on installing the newer versions. 
So many of us are having an older version of Firefox. Some of us would like to get the newer version of Firefox. Currently, the only options we have in locating  a newer add on similar to Tab Utilities is by installing a newer version of Firefox, and losing all we had, and install new add ons hopefully finding what we desire.  So, we (it is not just me, but a large group of people I am in contact with) are searching for some new add on that is similar to Tab Utilities so we can move on to the newer Firefox versions. Is there such an add on, and if so what is it's name and how does one find it?

Task Manager also only lists the processes, no applications. This process is very hard to kill, Task Manager can't end it, nor elevated rights Command Prompt TASKKILL with /FE, NirSoft NirCmd nor PSTools pskill64.exe nor Process Explorer. I have also tried ending all the other processes first I can think of, including explorer.exe, does not help. I'm testing with two administrator level accounts and I'm mostly working this problem with Firefox now, although Thunderbird shows the same symptoms.
</p><p>My system is a clone desktop computer Windows 7 PRO 64bit UK, AMD:n Phenom II CPU, GeForce 1050Ti display adapter.
</p><p>As antivirus I have Avira Free Antivirus, and I have some suspicions it may be the root of the problems this time. For couple of weeks ago it updated with a new user interface and installed new components. To test that, I tried to uninstall Avira. Each component needs to be uninstalled separately using Windows Programs and Features: two components uninstalled cleanly, one component left an open minimized window that one couldn't pop open nor close. Antivirus and VPN do not uninstall: after you are asked do you want to uninstall and answer YES, nothing else visible happens. If you try to start another uninstall job, you get a window telling you can't start another as one program is already being uninstalled or changed. And waiting doesn't help. I have a support question about it in Avira forum.
</p><p>Also last week, Flash Player installation failed with 89% done, tried twice and with same result. And the newest GeForce Graphics adapter drivers installation failed also. Both of those usually always install succesfully.
</p><p>Microsoft System File Checker SFC /SCANNOW does not find problems, nor does Windows disc chechker tool. I also run: File and Folder Troubleshooter winfilefolder.DiagCab and Microsoft Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter
MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab ja Program_Install_and_Uninstall.diagcab. Avira support recommends the Install and Uninstall troubleshooter to get rid of some old Avira rubbish. Also compared Windows folders rights to default rights listed in some web site: did not find differences with the couple of dozen folders I compared. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) according to Process Explorer is enabled looking at Firefox.exe process properties. I know command lines to change DEP settings and found it in System Performance Properties settings also, but have not touched it.
</p><p>I've removed Firefox and Thunderbird parent.lock -files, with Firefoxilla both from profile folder C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME and temporary folder C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox before trying to start Firefox again. And since I can't kill the process otherwise, it also means after rebooting the computer.
</p><p>Found an advice opening Firefox with SHIFT-key down, should open a safe-mode of the browser. Well, opened
only the process in my case.
</p><p>There are no previous session related saves (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js)
in the profile folder any more, and the sessionstore-backups folder is empty.
</p><p>I removed the Firefox installation, rebooted, and installed the 73.0 version 13.02.2020. It behaves similarly:
only the process starts.
</p><p>Added -p parameter to the Firefox shortcut, and in Windows SAFE MODE  was able to create a new profile: in normal mode Windows the window for creating/changing profile does not open. Firefox doesn't open application window in Windows safe mode either, also tried to run it as administrator option, and pressing SHIFT key, but neither helped. The newly created profile folder only has one file: times.json.
</p><p>When installed Firefox again, it wasn't a clean installation: the Firefox folder was empty of files, but I did install into the same folder. Also did not edit register nor delete the profile folder. Which is what I'm gonna try next. However, Thunderbird does not use Firefox's profile, so why does it stop opening the application window same time with Firefox? I don't think Firefox's profile folder can cause all these installation problems and Thunderbird problem. My bet is more likely Avira.

Install ja Uninstall troublesooter -tyÃ¶kalulla koitin poistaa myÃ¶s mahdollisesti wanhojen Aviran asennusten jÃ¤Ã¤miÃ¤ (Aviran tuki suosittelee myÃ¶s niin tekemÃ¤Ã¤n). Vertailin myÃ¶s Windows kansioiden kÃ¤yttÃ¤jÃ¤oikeuksia alkuperÃ¤isiin (NetistÃ¤ lÃ¶ytyi sivu jolla niistÃ¤ on listaus) enkÃ¤ havainnut erilaisuuksia niissÃ¤ muutamassa tusinassa jonka tarkistin. Data Execution Prevention (DEP) nÃ¤kyi olevan Process Explorerin mukaan olevan pÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ (Enabled) Firefox-prosessinkin ominaisuuksia katsoessa, en ole siihen itse kajonnut, lÃ¶ysin kyllÃ¤ sen asetuksen Windowsin jÃ¤rjestelmÃ¤n suorituskyvyn ominaisuuksista, ja komentokehoiteohjeet, jos nyt siitÃ¤ kiikastaisi.  
</p><p>Firefoxista ja ThunderbirdistÃ¤ olen poistanut parent.lock -tiedostot, Firefoxilla sekÃ¤ profiilikansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME sekÃ¤ vÃ¤liaikaistalletusten kansiosta C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp\firefox ennen kuin olen kÃ¤ynnistÃ¤nyt selainta uudestaan, ja koska prosessia ei saa tapettua, se tarkoittaa siis ettÃ¤ aina koneen uudelleenkÃ¤ynnistymisen jÃ¤lkeen.
</p><p>LÃ¶ysin neuvon avata Firefox klikkaamalla kuvaketta ja pitÃ¤mÃ¤llÃ¤ SHIFT-nÃ¤ppÃ¤intÃ¤ pohjassa, mutta sillÃ¤ ei ollut eroa mun tapauksessani: vain prosessi kÃ¤ynnistyy.
</p><p>Profiilista olen poistanut edellisen istunnon tiedostot (sessionCheckpoints.json, sessionstore.jsonlz4, sessionstore.js)
ja sessionstore-backups kansio on tyhjÃ¤.
</p><p>Poistin Firefoxin asennuksen, boottasin ja asensin uusimman 73.0 version 13.02.2020. Sama ongelma jatkui senkin kanssa.
</p><p>LisÃ¤sin kuvakkeeseen kÃ¤ynnistyspolun perÃ¤Ã¤n -P argumentin, ja Windowsin SAFE-modessa sillÃ¤ sai kÃ¤ynnistymÃ¤Ã¤n ikkunan jossa voi luoda uuden profiilin ja valita mitÃ¤ profiilia kÃ¤ytetÃ¤Ã¤n. Jos kÃ¤ynnisti Windowsin normaalisti, niin tuokaan ikkuna ei aukea. Firefox ei kyllÃ¤ kÃ¤ynnistynyt Windowsin SAFE-modessakaan. Kokeilin myÃ¶s Run as administrator ja SHIFT-napin kanssa, mutta ei kÃ¤ynnisty. Uuteen profiiliin tuli vain yksi ainoa tiedosto: times.json.
</p><p>Kun asensin uuden version Firefoxista, se ei ollut aivan ""clean Install"", eli asensin saman nimiseen kansioon, joka kyllÃ¤ oli tyhjÃ¤ tiedostoista, enkÃ¤ kÃ¤ynyt rekisteriÃ¤ lÃ¤pi, enkÃ¤ poistanut edellistÃ¤ profiilia. MikÃ¤ lieneekin seuraava yritys. Joku neuvoi myÃ¶s place.sqlite -tiedostoa poistamaan/uudelleennimeÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤n, jota voin kanssa kokeilla. TÃ¤ssÃ¤ on nyt kuitenkin huomionarvoista se, ettÃ¤ Firefoxin lisÃ¤ksi Thunderbird alkoi samalla hetkellÃ¤ kÃ¤yttÃ¤ytymÃ¤Ã¤n samalla tavalla. Ja sehÃ¤n ei ilmeisesti mitenkÃ¤Ã¤n Firefoxin profiilia kÃ¤ytÃ¤, joten epÃ¤ilen kyllÃ¤ Aviraakin enemmÃ¤n kuin ettÃ¤ Firefoxin profiili olisi tÃ¤hÃ¤n kaikkeen syypÃ¤Ã¤.
