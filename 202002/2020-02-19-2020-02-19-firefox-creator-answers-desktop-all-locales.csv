I was using Firefox Sync earlier today and then had to delete the profile and created a new profile.
While logging into Firefox I have had to reset the password as I couldn't recall the credentials. Now I don't see any login information.

1280213,2020-02-18 17:01:08 -0800,2020-02-18T17:01:08Z,Webrtc doesn't work on Firefox 68 ESR in Linux system,"<p>Firefox 68 ESR is the latest version for Linux system on Raspberry Pi but I don't know why it is not working with Webrtc.
I had tested some Webrtc samples and website with Firefox 68.4.1ESR on Linux system of Raspberry Pi 3. They all return some errors.
For example, AppRTC video chat client powered by Google App Engine:  <a href=""https://appr.tc/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://appr.tc/</a>
The result  is showing like the images. It can't show the device name when I accept the camera and microphone permission then return error message.
Then I tried Firefox 60, it works fine with Webrtc sample on Raspberry Pi 3.
As a final test, I downloaded the Firefox 68.4.1ESR version at my laptop with Win10 system and test it. Everything is fine.
I am sure the camera and microphone is fine because Firefox 60 can run the sample normally.
May I get some help to figure out the problem of the Firefox 68.4.1ESR on the Raspberry Pi with Linux system and how can I make it work with Webrtc?
