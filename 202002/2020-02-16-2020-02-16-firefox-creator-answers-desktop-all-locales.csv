Containers, from my understanding and trials, whilst stopping cross-site cookie sharing, still do not achieve the above.
Even more so, it seems logical to assume that in Private mode the cookie jar is shared by all sites --and shared!-- since Containers are not designed/ allowed in this mode.

I have 8.0 Gb of RAM 64 bit system.
I have gone into task manager and noticed that there were several line items open under firefox, I have limited these to three since then bu am not convinced that was an issue. What I have also noticed is that all of them show a last accessed date of over 15 hours ago. The computer has been off since then and restarted several times. 
System is still slow.
I also have over 70 lines of svchost.exe files open in the task manager. None of them show a lot of activity I just think that is odd.

The json backups have not worked correctly they ar,"<p>Firefox 73.0 bookmarks disappeared I am running os x 10.13.6 I am unsure what to do to recover my bookmarks. The json backups have not worked correctly they are 6 months months outdated it seems
no idea why this is. Export HTML has not worked for many months either. I am so fed up as I needed all the research as we speak. Its causing insane problems. Are Json files stored someone else that I can find and use ?
</p><p>Screen shot of my profile is attached.  If I can find a Json file backed up else where please direct me to it and I will start from the beginning  again I just need the bookmarks soooo badly ASAP.

In that window I expect a small top bar with a close (cross) and print (printer) icons, as shown in the first image added (obtained with Linux Ubuntu 18.04, Firefox 71). 
</p><p>Instead, in a computer with Linux Ubuntu 14.04 and Firefox 66, I get gigantic icons, as wide as the page width, as shown in the second image added. This is certainly an issue when I want to print to file; I have not tried and sent the job to a printer since I am not interested in that use at this moment. It used to work fine for years until a certain point, but I cannot pinpoint when it went wrong and the possible whys. Note that the body of the mail is formatted regularly, and that also the icons at the bottom (say, an attachment) are magnified disproportionately.
</p><p>There is an archived post in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176032"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176032</a> that reports a similar problem. However, the diagnose is different. The large icon is not an issue of yahoo mail on two counts: 1) the big X and printer icons are supposed to be there, and the issue is that they are magnified without a reason; 2) the problem does not arise with the same webmail service in other computers. I suspect that it must be some local setting of Firefox that has been changed in a mistake? 
</p><p>Any ideas on fixes and workarounds? Thanks for helping out

How can I set the window size (1024x768 or 1366x768 or another) that I need? So that I open the browser and the window size matches the resolution I need.
</p><p>What I did:
</p><p>Set the values to `privacy.window.maxInnerHeight` and `privacy.window.maxInnerWidth`. But the size is 1000x700, 1400x800, etc., i.e. not the one i need.
</p><p>Used `privacy.resistfingerprinting.letterboxing` with the specified resolution in `.dimensions`, it seems to work. BUT, this works with a delay. I open a test page in which resolution is displayed through `&lt;body onload=""alert (window.innerWidth)""&gt;` and at the very beginning the real value is displayed and only then changed using letterboxing. That is, it is possible to intercept the real value.
</p><p>I tried to resize the window through `Window.resizeTo ()`, but it does not change.
</p><p>Tell me how to launch a browser with a window of the desired size with privacy.resistfingerprinting enabled?

</p><p>Firefox versions 70-74, developer version and stable;
Ubuntu 19.10 with Wayland/ Sway;
Internal Monitor 3000x2000 with scaling ratio 2.0 + External Monitor 1920x1080 with scaling ratio 1.0  
</p><p>Ever since version 70 I noticed that Firefox would on first start scale either according to the external or internal monitor, and be perfectly workable on that one. But when moving it to the other monitor/ opening a new window on the other monitor it would not scale properly, but render according to the scaling factor of the other monitor. So, e.g. when moving from the internal to the external screen it would only render to the top left quarter of the screen, while the application was actually being the right size. At the same time the input mapping was according to the actual window dimensions, and not according to the visual rendering of Firefox. This would also happen the other way round, with Firefox then only rendering the top left part of the web page to the entire screen.
</p><p>You can see this well on the attached screenshot, but notice that sway is a tiling window manager, so Firefox should actually be exactly the same size as the terminal next to it. Firefox also renders like this when the scaling factor was changed at run time, so the issue seems to me that Firefox on Wayland checks the scaling factor on startup just once globally and does not realize when it was changed or that it can be different on different monitors.

</p><p>I used to use the Crome Browser. I switched to Firefox and that's fine, I use the Google search page in Firefox and that works fine, but in the search bar there is normally a microphone, where I can enter the search text, but in the version I use in Firefox that microphone is missing. That's a pity. Does anyone know a way to get that microphone back into the search bar of the Google search page?
I'd really appreciate it and I'd love to hear about it.

One might hope that it would just be the first time, and that it would be quicker for subsequent saves. But no, it is always slow, every time.
And sometimes, maybe after some flashing into and disappearing from view, it finally appears, on top, but does not have focus/is not active.

I followed the troubleshooting steps posted in this community to ensure that ""Preview in Firefox"" appears as a drop-down (it did not originally) and that it was selected.  (Steps involved getting a cleaned up version of mimeTypes.rdf and handlers.json.)  Still, when I click on a the link I was testing this with, it asks me ""What should Firefox do with this file?"" and if I manually select ""Open with...Other...Firefox,"" it will open in Firefox but still download to my PC.  Am I right that the user experience should always be that it automatically opens a new tab and displays the PDF there while NOT downloading to the user's PC?  That being said, I tested another random PDF and it did what it was supposed to.  I only tested these 2 after I did the fixes so I don't have a high sample size to say if it mostly works or mostly doesn't.  There was no discernible difference between the two files: both of their extensions were ""pdf,"" they both had kind of long filenames, and they both had ~100 pages in their files.
</p><p>I would like to get away from downloading files I: 1) don't want to keep and 2) don't trust on my PC but want to read.
