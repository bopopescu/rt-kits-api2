Now, that feature doesn't work because now when I press a single letter trying to perform the short cut, the find bar pops up at the bottom of the screen, rendering my shortcuts useless for this webpage. This is happening on multiple machines and on any given website, not just the one i use with shortcuts. How do I disable the find bar popping up? Why is this feature happening now, was this in a new update? This does not happen in other browsers, it is Firefox specific.

</p><p>As I realized some time ago, Firefox makes simulatneous requests againgst disk cache and network called ""Race Cache With Network"" (explained here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1267945)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1267945)</a>. In my home country, this has never bothered me as I had an unlimited data plan and therefore was pleased to get fast loading webpages.
</p><p>But now, I moved to a country without unlimited data plans (Ghana, 40GB per month, 120GHC, approx. 20€, approx. 22USD) and I'm thinking about how this feature must be eating up peoples data. Because even if you visited a webpage before and most of data is within your disk cache, Firefox will still issue a network request, resulting in increased network activity and therefore consuming additional data.
</p><p>In my opinion this adversely affects people in emerging countries, as internet is already a pricey good and Firefox is using more data than necessary, just to allow webpages to load fractions of seconds faster.
</p><p>Why is there no UI option (I know it can be turned off, using config key ""network.http.rcwn.enabled"") for users to turn this feature off more easily in order to save data? Furthermore, this behaviour is not even explained to users, so users might not even know Firefox consumes more data than expected.

I reinstalled FF after automatically downloading 73.0 and I had a terrible day on computer yesterday.  SLOW.  It was fine today, for some reason, so there are no issues I can detect.
Because I have an old laptop, should I download the 32-bit version?
I spent a lot of time restoring FF, even though I thought everything would rollover.
Can I do the change w/o reinstalling everything???
