When I click on the print button, nothing happens. I can print the web page use ctrl+p or selecting print from the menu, but it doesn't print the webpage correctly. The print button works fine in IE and edge, but I do not wish to use either of those browsers. Any ideas on how to ge this to work? I must add, my work has relied on IE for years but now that IE is going away, they are redesigning the web pages to work with other browsers. So, I think it is quite possible that this is an issue with their web sites.

These problems does not always happens, but they does repeat from time to time. I think the problem is related to Firefox on Ubuntu.
</p><p>Problems:
- First, changing language input cases Firefox to become a little slow and lose focus for a second or less.
</p><p>- duckduckgo: Not the main site, but after making a search (for example: <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=test)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=test)</a>. If you are on this site and change language input, and then press ""h"" it selects all the search text. pressing ""v"" shows a message that Firefox has prevented a pop-up (which is the first search result. If you allow pop-up, it will open that result).
</p><p>- Facebook: When writing in the mini-chat, changing language input makes the chat to lose focus. Writing when the chat is in that state can cause the chat to disappear. It seems like the chat element is blocked from HTML, even if I click on chats or contacts to open a new chat, the chat does not appear any more. Moving from a Facebook link to another by clicking on page elements (using ajax) does not remove that ""block"". The only solution is to reload the page.

I end up opening the same pdf multiple times to view different pages on different tabs, and I really would rather not have to close the yellow banner every time I open the pdf.

If I manually refresh, the page does become up-to-date, but it's a small annoyance.
