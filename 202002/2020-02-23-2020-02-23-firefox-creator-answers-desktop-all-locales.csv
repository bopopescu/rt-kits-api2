</p><p>SEARCH FILE TYPES AND APPLICATIONS (for downloads) I HAVE NO IDEA, Using Windows 7 was very easy, I just named the file in SAVE  AS there was a drop down box for downloads, documents, etc. WHY WOULD anyone want their downloads in MS Outlook?  As it stands now, I don't know where most of my downloads, documents, photos are located in Firefox. Even in Outlook 365 Word they are all over the place. DO NOT want them in Outlook Word, which is where they seem to go. I have selected web site addresses to download, instead of ""save as"" it wants the FILE TYPE. I hate every program on my PC, want Windows 7 back and Outlook 2013. I thought Firefox would be easier, heard good things, but right now I could throw it out the window. BTW, I have logged into Grammarly 4 times today, and once again it's asking me to login. I have more logins now than ever before in my computer lifetime. I'm not IT and an engineer, half the words used these days are Greek to me. Been working with computers for over 40 years, DOS, most of Windows programs or Apps or whatever they called these days, always a learning curve, but after 5 months, it's only gotten worse. Every phone call to MS support is a JOKE. 1 person says this, another persons says oh no this is what you need to do!! Printer no longer works after MS big PATCH. I dread calling HP again, but have no choice.
Sorry I have just dumped all over you, but I am so angry with all of this I have screamed!

I keep getting the message ""You May Now Close This Window""","<p>This problem started a few days ago. (Latest Firefox Update???) I log in to <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>. The screen comes up normally with the Folders Pane on the Left, the E-mail Title Pane in the middle and the smaller Preview pane on the right of the screen. Normally I double click on the middle Title Pane and it selects and pops up to show the larger expanded e-mail. A few days ago the problem started that now when I double click on the middle Title Pane a message pops up ""You May Now Close This Window"". I can't get the e-mail to appear in the expanded middle pane. I switched to Chrome which is an alternate Browser that I use and I Did Not Have This Problem. Apparently the problem is caused by a change that Firefox made in the last few days. I have used Firefox as my default Browser for many years now and love this Browser. I have tried everything I could think of including allowing Popups for the <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> website, and clearing the Firefox cache, but the problem still exists. Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated. I do not want to have to use another Browser other than Firefox. I will be upgrading to Windows 10 from 7 in the next few weeks, but I'm not sure Windows 7 is the issue since <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> works with no problems with Windows 7 using the Chrome Browser.

When i click to run 73 I immediately got a window that says Firefox has stopped working: check online for a solution/close/debug. i uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, deleted all the Mozilla data on my machine and still had the exact same problem w/ 73 and 72:

I have comodo and peerblock installed, but I turned them off during the download and installation. I rolled back to 43 and for the moment it seems to be working fine. I'm on Windows 7. I've found questions similar to this, but not exactly the same. One suggested using version 72, but that didn't solve the problem.
</p><p>Thanks very much.
