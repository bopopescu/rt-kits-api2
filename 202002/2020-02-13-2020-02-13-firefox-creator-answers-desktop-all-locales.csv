It does keep previous session when I try to troubleshoot - so I mean starting it, opening couple of tabs and trying to restart - 
but unfortunately it does not if FF kept opened for days or weeks. 
That's a pain, as lot of pinned tabs collected to the moment and I simply do not remember what was that weeks ago and it's not so easy to search throughout the history. 
</p><p>Of course, Startup set to Restore previous session and History set to Remember.  
I am aware there might be sessionstore.js or something like this, but might be there is some additional magic option to be set to avoid the issue? 
I am aware of that ""last window to close - the only to remember"" problem. This is not the case. 
</p><p>Just one window. Only pinned tabs. Clean window on start. No option to restore previous session (it's empty).
</p><p>Appreciate any idea. 
Thanks.

</p><p>Yesterday a top margin of the ""New tab"" page (""top sites"" etc. page) suddenly became missing (not centered vertically) in my Firefox 73.0. This page displays broken for any Firefox profile (for Firefox instances of other users of the same Windows), so resetting (""refreshing"") Firefox is not a solution, and most simple Firefox reinstallation also did not help. 
</p><p>(I believe there are no screenshot needed here, as anybody knows what is a large top margin of a centered [div] entity, and how does its absence should look.)

There are also no any add-ons\extensions\plugins\themes in Firefox, and no Flash or Java installed.
</p><p>A similar question (№ 1268604) already exists here for a few months, but I decided to also begin a new thread for the issue, because the problem is quite sensitive for me - I do not want to reset entire PC to get rid of this tiny bug, even though I guess this would help a bit :)
</p><p>Can anybody clearly explain me, what and why has changed in my Firefox files yesterday and how can I fix this by any obvious tiny configuration actions or something alike? I still believe that a solution different from complex hardcore action exists for my case :'/

They do NOT load on any Firefox browser on tablets, phone, laptop, desktop. But do load on any other browser. But they did before.
I have NOT changed anything other than Firefox updates. I do not have any extensions, add-ons.
All applies to one internet provider and since the pages load on any other browser besides Firefox, I assume the problem is Firefox.
I really liked Firefox until today. I'm at a loss, can anyone help with this, please?

</p><p>Today, I got a new drop-down from the address bar about Firefox blocking social media sites from tracking me.  I can't complain about that -- at least, not until some problem pops up for me as a result of it -- but it is obscuring the control to allow Flash to run, and by the time I got the new drop-down cleared the control did not allow Flash to run and I had to reload the page.
</p><p>However well-intentioned the developers are, I still maintain that they should -- until Flash officially deprecates at the end of the year -- allow a decision made by the user to allow Flash at a specific website to be saved by Firefox and eliminate the daily hassle of re-authorizing.  ESPECIALLY SINCE NOW THAT OTHER ENHANCEMENTS INTERFERE WITH THE FLASH ALLOWING DROP-DOWN.
</p><p>This is my ongoing request, which will be made on every new release this year until the developers understand that they are making the experience of using Firefox less user-friendly.  All because they just couldn't wait for the Flash deprecation to change how Firefox treats that plug-in.

It doesn't help at all, in fact it actually makes it even harder for some of us to utilize the browser.

I utilize a high contrast setting on my computer with the black background and white text. The web browser now ignores that and visiting some web sites it is like looking into a bright flashlight. Is there any way to disable or turn off the new color functionality?
</p><p>I have also found that trying to use browser themes no longer stays. What I mean is that after setting a ""theme"" it works until you open a new tab or window and then it goes back to the firefox defaul theme. When checking the add on theme it still says that the theme I wanted is selected and enabled but in truth it isn't.
