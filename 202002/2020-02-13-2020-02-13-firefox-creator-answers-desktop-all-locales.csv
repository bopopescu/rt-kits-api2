One of the things that it used to have before it had been updated was a simple arrow-down button that, when clicked, showed the most visited sites. Now, after the update, this button is gone (pic related). This makes my experience with Firefox *extremely* worse, because now I don't have a quick access to open one of my most visited sites inside the current tab without starting typing their addresses. Is there any option to bring that feature back? Is removal of this button an already-made design choice for Firefox that will stay with us for the next versions?

After upgrading to v73 all files ( rar, zip.. ) that I used to save to a directory of my choice now default to open with ( eg winrar ). The dialog window still shows up with the ""open with / save file"" options, but before, once I picked ""save file"" it did remember the last choice and had ""save file"" choice set on concurrent downloads - now it does not, it defaults to ""open with"".
Now, when I un-register the eg. rar extension in Windows, and Firefox does not know what to open it with, it will remember the ""save file"" choice. As soon as I register the file type ( rar, 7z, zip.... ) it starts defaulting to ""open with"".
It becomes a pain and adds one more step to the file download to set ""save file""... It is also easy to just click ""open"" and instead of the download going to the desired directory, it opens it with the application it 'knows'. It is often far from the desired behavior, and it changed on 12FEB2020 when FF got updated to v73.
I have also removed and edited handlers.json - no luck

It does keep previous session when I try to troubleshoot - so I mean starting it, opening couple of tabs and trying to restart - 
but unfortunately it does not if FF kept opened for days or weeks. 
That's a pain, as lot of pinned tabs collected to the moment and I simply do not remember what was that weeks ago and it's not so easy to search throughout the history. 
</p><p>Of course, Startup set to Restore previous session and History set to Remember.  
I am aware there might be sessionstore.js or something like this, but might be there is some additional magic option to be set to avoid the issue? 
I am aware of that ""last window to close - the only to remember"" problem. This is not the case. 
</p><p>Just one window. Only pinned tabs. Clean window on start. No option to restore previous session (it's empty).

How do I disable the new color functionality?,"<p>With the new firefox browser update they included color functionality that was supposed to ""help"" those of us with color vision issues. It doesn't help at all, in fact it actually makes it even harder for some of us to utilize the browser. Now with web sites like yahoo email and ebay, just to name two, there are color accents that are forced upon the user. I utilize a high contrast setting on my computer with the black background and white text. The web browser now ignores that and visiting some web sites it is like looking into a bright flashlight. Is there any way to disable or turn off the new color functionality?
</p><p>I have also found that trying to use browser themes no longer stays. What I mean is that after setting a ""theme"" it works until you open a new tab or window and then it goes back to the firefox defaul theme. When checking the add on theme it still says that the theme I wanted is selected and enabled but in truth it isn't.
</p><p>The first screen shot shows what the theme should be but you can see that it is not working and that happens with any selected and enabled theme.
</p><p>The second screen shot shows the bright blue bar at the top of the yahoo email page. It used to be black until the 2-11-2020 update of firefox.
</p><p>The third screen shot is of an ebay page after the update. 
</p><p>I know it seems trivial to those of you with normal color vision but when you cannot work with the color  nor change what you are seeing, it is more than just frustrating.
