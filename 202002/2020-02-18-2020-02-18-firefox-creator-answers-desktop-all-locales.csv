I realized that the latest version 73.01 was available but I had not received any notification of the update from my public IP of 104.158.49.18.
</p><pre>When I updated to 73 by directly downloading the file from ""<a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/</a>"" and installed the upgrade went directly to version 73.01 so I downgraded it to 73 and noticed that my profile was erased. 
</pre>
<p>Why would FF not notify me of a new realease since 2 versions where available 73 and 73.01 ?
Is it normal for a minor version 73.01 to 73.0 downgrade to erase the profile ? I know a major version does this.

1280208,2020-02-18 13:37:51 -0800,2020-02-18T19:42:42Z,Feature Suggestion: Default container option in Multi-Account Containers,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>I would find it very useful to be able to designate a default container (which could be ""No Container"") for sites that are not already assigned to a container.  In other words, with this feature, if a link is opened from a page in container X, but the link does not have a container associated with it, the tab would open in the default container rather than container X.  To give a concrete example:  My Google searches &amp; news are in a Google container.  When I click a search result, e.g., from a news organization that I don't visit enough to make a container for, I'd prefer it did not open in the Google container, but a different, generic one or No Container.
</p><p>I realize there could be some odd side-effects if a site spans multiple domains or hosts if they're not all marked for one container, but as an optional feature I think it wouldn't bother people who don't want to deal with that possibility.
</p><p>Another way to do something similar would be to allow users to mark a container as ""exclusive,"" meaning any link not in the sites assigned to that container would automatically go to No Container in the absence of an assignment.  These two options also be implemented and work together.
</p><p>Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this or if there's already a way to do this that I just haven't found.  Thanks for any help!

(I only recently found I'm not the only one with this issue.) But even doing that often doesn't work once I click the emote pop-up again. I've tried resetting everything, I've tried disabling add-ons, basically I've tried all the standard stuff listed in the trouble-shooting guides but nothing seemed to solve the problem. 
</p><p>I'm not sure why the streams (audio &amp; video) stop when I click the emotes, which has always been an issue but usually just clicking the low-latency button - twice! - solves that issue. This audio static seems to be a whole different thing because reloading the page is the only way I've found to get rid of that problem and then it often happens again when I click the emotes pop-up.

In version 73.0 of Feb 11, 2020 Mozilla introduced a “readability backplate” solution which places a block of background color between the text and background image.
As a Low vision individual I do rely on Windows High contrast black theme to remove any bright color blocks from the screen background.
Unfortunately the new Readability backplate feature brings these color blocks back which actually make websites harder for me to read. 
For example buttons, image blocks with or without wording  now appear in white background which is precisely what I need to move away from.
Can I disable the readability backplate or disable background images?
In the mean time how do I go back to version 72.# please?
Thank you
