Suddenly they decide to autoplay when switching tabs - note, I've not done anything to my settings or plugins. Fair enough, maybe you changed something (which you often do, without informing). So I check the options. It was on ""Block audio"", which obviously didn't work, so I tried ""Block Audio and Video"" - which WORKS, but now both the video is paused (which I want) AND the audio is set to mute (which I DON'T want) - so... what does it take to have Youtube wait for a click to start playing a video loaded in a background tab, but KEEP AUDIO ACTIVE, so I don't also have to unmute the damn video?

If I try to open that site in a different browser it says the server can't be found, and if I do a DNS lookup for it it confirms that my system gets NXDOMAIN for that domain name:

</p><p>I have a Tumblr account and before any of the updates on Firefox I was able to view all of my postings.  Now I'm having trouble seeing my page, a complete blank screen.  I still hear music so sound is not the issue.  I attempted to fix the issue with Settings but the result is still the same.  Could you please offer some assistance.  It doesn't matter if I'm on private window or the normal window, both have the exact problem.

Part of my situation is that two of my three former email addresses were dropped when AOL bought Verizon's EMail Division and only let us bring 1 suitcase per person.  Trouble is, the other two addys were sub accounts, one was a Business Account so much of the info was quite detailed but the same.   But these days, data breaches are so comon (yawn?) it's almost not shocking.  But 8 ?  Yikes.  Here's the thing, I thank you for the alerts, but you scare me to death then leave me hanging.  I have no idea which 5 sites had the same PW  (huh ?). I supposed over 20 years online and at 2500 logins, at some point my brain ran out of creative unique login's. I use a Password Program but it doesn't catch 3 email addresses that may share a common PW.   Any suggestions how to ""Resolve"" those breaches which I can barely remember where I've left my britches ?  Thanks.  
5/2500  = .002 %  P.W.s repeated , not the worst odds in the world.  Spread that %  over a 22 year span,  the equation is so low there is an ""e"" in the final outcome !

- No webpage loads, or attempts to load. I just get blank page.
- This includes built in pages such as addons and settings.
Reinstalling does not help. Removing the profile does not help.
Downgrading to version 71 does work, and now I can use internet again.
