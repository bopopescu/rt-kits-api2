After double-clicking the icon, the cursor indicates the system is busy, but no icon appears on the taskbar and no window opens on screen. Task Manager shows a Firefox process running (not running before trying to start Firefox). With UAC activated, UAC window opens and asks whether to allow Firefox to make changes to the computer. After choosing Yes, the UAC window keeps opening and asking, over and over. Have reinstalled Firefox. Have tried to start Firefox in Safe Mode (both Shift&gt;double-click and Run command). Have tried to start Profile Manager from Run command (firefox.exe -P and ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -P). Neither Firefox nor Profile Manager will open. Found a file in the Profiles folder called Parent.Lock and deleted it, with no apparent effect. Would like to know what might get Firefox to work.

I am able to find my Word documents and pictures but I would like to find my browsing history and bookmarks on Firefox. It appears that a new version of Firefox is there.  Thank you for your help.

It went to 1.4 MB but never back to 0. I uninstalled Firefox then reinstalled it and now it's at 2.4 MB. I delete my cache, not cookies, every time without fail, so this is very frustration. Can anyone help me?

1280473,2020-02-22 13:41:27 -0800,2020-02-22T23:57:20Z,"When adding a new Bookmark, I cannot choose a new folder from the Dropdown to save to","<p>I am in the process of migrating over to Firefox from Chrome.  But seem to have issues with Bookmarks (Not importing them, but just the simple action of adding a new bookmark and saving them to whatever folder I want to organize it into)..  When I go to add a new Bookmark (clicking the Star Icon in the Address Bar), and I go to click the dropdown to choose a folder to where I want it saved, it always reverts back when I choose another folder.
</p><p>Steps:
</p><p>1. Go to website
</p><p>2. Click the Star Icon to add bookmark
</p><p>3. The folder option is usually set to the most recent folder a Bookmark was previously added to.
</p><p>4. Click the Folder dropdown (NOT the icon that shows all folders, but the actual dropdown) and select a new folder
</p><p>5. As soon as I select a new folder (doesn't matter where), it reverts back to the folder it was set to (in Step 3). 
</p><p><br>
The behavior seems to add the Bookmark to the location, but then does a ""CTL+Z"" (Undo so to speak), as seen when I try to add the new Bookmark to the Bookmarks Toolbar, I see it there for half a second before it reverts.
</p><p><br>
The only way for me to move the location of the bookmark where I want it saved is to:
</p><p>1.  Hit the button next to the Folders dropdown to Show All Bookmarks Folders and select the folder
</p><p>or
</p><p>2.  In the Folders dropdown, select ""Choose..."" which does Step 1 in showing all the bookmarks folders.
</p><p><br>
If I restart Firefox, it will work, for the FIRST Bookmark I add.  I can use the dropdown to save the Bookmark to whatever folder I choose.  But any new bookmark after that, reverts to the problem behavior again.
</p><p>I have tried to do a clean Install of Firefox (Uninstall Firefox, then Delete %AppData%/Roaming.Mozilla/Firefox and %AppData%/Local/Mozilla/Firefox folders respectively)
</p><p>I have also disabled all extensions, and the behavior still persists (For reference I have the following extensions installed: 1Password, Alternate Player for Twitch, Clippings, Facebook Container, NoScript and uBlock Origin).
</p><p>Not sure what other steps I can take?  
</p><p>(Is there a way for me to create a gif showing this behavior?)
