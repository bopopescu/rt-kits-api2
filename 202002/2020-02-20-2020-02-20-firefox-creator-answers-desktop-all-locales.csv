Came back after lunch, restarted the computer because my writing software wouldn't open, and then everything but Firefox was fine.  Everything in the window, all the tabs, look like smeared unreadable paint.  I uninstalled Firefox, restarted the computer, and reinstalled Firefox.  Still no good.  How do I fix this please?

When clicking the icon it bounces once and then disappears from the dock. Honestly, this started happening about August 2018, and in my troubleshooting decided to give the Developer edition a try, and for some reason that one worked so I stuck with it.
</p><p>Shortly thereafter (a week or two) whenever I closed down the Mac, Firefox Dev wouldn't re-open. Deleting and reinstalling would work, but I'd have to re-set all my settings, re-activate the theme, etc., and all the browsing history would be lost. So, since then I would rarely shut it down. 
</p><p>A few days ago I had to shut the Mac down completely, but this time Firefox Dev wouldn't open after re-installing. Oddly, I tried regular Firefox again as a solution, and it opened this time. I tested it out by shutting the Mac down completely, then restarting, and it retained all of the settings! I was really glad to once again be able to shut down my laptop at the end of the day without the headache of having to reinstall and re-set everything.
</p><p>Then this morning, boom - back to the same nonsense, except now it won't open at all. Neither the regular FF or the Developer edition will work. I've done clean uninstalls to see if that was the problem, as in: removed them from the Applications folder, removed them from the Downloads folder, removed the /Firefox folder from user/Library/Application Support/, and emptying the Trash.
</p><p>I saw in one Support post to delete the fbplugin file, 'as that had been causing Firefox to crash'. The closest I found to an 'fbplugin' file was a bundle-config.1 file, which contained 'fbplugin' throughout the file code numerous times. I renamed it temporarily, but didn't delete it. That didn't help the non-opening problem either.  
</p><p>I also tried installing Firefox v 71, same result as the others.
</p><p>Keep in mind after attempting all of these solutions of deleting, reinstalling, changing file names, etc., I did a complete shutdown and restart.  Also, I have not downloaded, updated, or changed anything since last week's phenomenon of regular Firefox beginning to work again.  So I'm completely stumped and would appreciate any help.  I'm currently running macOS Catalina 10.15.3.  TIA.

</p><p>Since starting Firefox up today, every single attempted open link or tab crashes. A new, blank tab will crash, and even some about:tabs crash and must be attempted a few times to access. After going through multiple troubleshooting guides from both Mozilla and from users, I'm at a complete loss. A list of things I've tried:
</p><p>-Restoring crashed tabs
-Restarting Firefox
-Restarting Firefox in Safe Mode
-Clearing Cookies &amp; Cache
-Removing all addons and plugins
-Restarting PC
-Reinstalling Firefox
-""Refreshing"" Firefox 
-Making a new account
-Restarting Firefox in Safe Mode after reinstall/refresh/new account
-Checking browser internals
-Troubleshooting/Reinstalling Flash
-Checking for security software/malware issues
-Switching browser.tabs.remote.autostart to false
-Switching media.wmf.vp8.enabled to false
-Checking that drivers are up to date
-Switching to an older version of Firefox
-Making a new profile for an older version of Firefox
-Re-reverting to the current version of Firefox
-Restarting PC another time and trying these again
</p><p>Despite all of this, all tabs save for the about:tabs (excluding about:blank) crash immediately. I have no idea what else I can try, and any assistance would be appreciated.

</p><p>I'm using Firefox Sync for longer to sync bookmarks and logins between Firefoxes on my private Linux box and Firefox on a private Android Smartphone.
</p><p>As I wanted to have my logins (esp. their usually nowadays pretty complex passwords :-)) also available on my company's laptop's Firefox, but ONLY the logins, NOT the (many) bookmarks, don't want to mix business bookmarks with private ones, I've enbled Firefox Sync for the first time on the company#s laptop.
</p><p>Unfortunately Firefox Sync took ALL information possible, bookmarks, logins and even history, and synced it to my Android also. Bidirectional! 
Some work to wipe this.
There has been no option in the phase of connecting my company's laptop to Firefox sync to select the sync scope itself, unfortunately. 
</p><p>- Is this ""working as designed""? Or did I miss something?
</p><p>Before wiping both my company's laptop and my Android, I've set the sync options to ""Logins only"" on the company's laptop. To be sure NOT to get any wiped bookmarks deleted at their origins/source Firefoxes. 
</p><p>Having done this. my Android Sync settings have been also set (automatically?) to ""Logins only"", no Bookmarks sync anymore. 
</p><p>- I this correct? Only one sync options set valid for ALL devices ""belonging"" to a Firefox Sync account? 
Docs are somewhat vague about this, at least what I've found here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-choose-what-types-information-sync-firefox#w_manage-sync-information-on-a-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-choose-what-types-information-sync-firefox#w_manage-sync-information-on-a-computer</a>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure about ""automatically set"", but because of the work to get things sorted out after the unwanted sync I do not want to test again :-S
