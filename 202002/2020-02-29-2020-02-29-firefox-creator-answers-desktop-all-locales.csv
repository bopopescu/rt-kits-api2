1281030,2020-02-29 14:58:57 -0800,2020-02-29T15:58:49Z,How safe is it to use multiple profiles in the same firefox version? And multiple profiles in different firefox version (stable and beta)?,"<p>Dear Mozilla team,
I'd like to set up 2 different profiles: one for email, banking and other sensitive stuff and the other for general web surfing.
Honestly, so far I've used Firefox for the first job and Chrome for the second one.
Now I would like to try to set-up 2 profiles in Firefox to use it for both purposes
While I used to use 2 different browsers before, now I would use the same browser, which can access both profiles.
I'm afraid that if I browse with my hobby profile, a possible threat could easily access or compromise the data of the second profile. 
Is the solution of using 2 different browsers actually more secure?
What if I use the stable version together with the beta version of Firefox instead?
I would like clarification on this.
Thanks

</p><p>Ideally, isn't this kind of ""anti"" privacy ? Some add-on that always worked flawless and only NOW after an update,needs access to/ more control to continue what is always did before without?
</p><p>That raises concern to me from a privacy standpoint..... I'm just wondering though If i should allow it stay with older version...
</p><p>To me, the way privacy is generally handed would be addon developers get you 'hooked', and to give you calm they tell you the 'added"" borderlne privacy they must now have access to, is ""required""to usually give you more features or more alerts (just to make anyone feel safer as an add-on protecting you more, when in fact its slowly doing exactly the opposite.. This way by edging more and more overtime, users will by blind to how much access ""privacy""add-ons even get.)
</p><p>My privacy is mine..... so any short-falls like more access when it previously worked ok is an instant 'red flag' to me... and would be with anything.
</p><p>Any suggestions? I'm sure other people here also in the same boat with uBlock Origion update, and privacy focused, so what did you do?

Then I install firefox in another PC named Pc-B and sign in to sync. 
I understand, Firefox sync won't sync customized UI, and add-on settings. 
But, here is my questions: 
Why do all add-ons in PC-A have a reset?  For example, an add-on foxclocks was added in PC-A at beginning, lots of city were added. But after fresh setup of firefox in PC-B, the city list in this add-on will be reverted to default list. And other add-on has the same behavior. 
Why do the theme in PC-A revert back to default? If I applied a theme on firefox of PC-A first. Then I sign in in the fresh installed firefox on PC-B, The theme of PC-A will be synced to the default theme, like the PC-B one. 
I know the sync should be bi-direction. But the setting of PC-A is already exited in server. And setting of PC-B is all default like blank paper. So the sync of PC-B should be download only, instead of upload default settings.
