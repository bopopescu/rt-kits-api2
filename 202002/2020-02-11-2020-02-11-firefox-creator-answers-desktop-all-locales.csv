(this is not a cookie as such),"<p>This is a direct question as to whether Firefox saves any user NON DELETEABLE information. It appears Chrome does. These are not cookies or history as I know it. Presumably after Chrome has uploaded to a server somewhere it is then deleted or perhaps there is a timed or storage limit delete. The Chrome explanation is that ""it makes the user experience faster and better"". More likely is that google is increasingly being denied cookie &amp; tracking data because of privacy addons or public opinion, they have a new way to get most of the same information. They just call it a ""profile"" rather than a cookie.

This has happened several times.,"<p>On several occasions, FF72.02 has coased all my favicons to disappear (Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit). How can I recover these. Neither backing up the bookmarks as .json file nor backing up HTML bookmarks allows me to recover. Is there any file I can save to ensure the favicons are backed up. At one time there was an add-on, ""Favicon Restorer"" that worked resaonably well but it has not been available for some time. Restoring favicons manually is an extremely time consuming process and is no guarantee the they will not disapper again. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

</p><p>As a concern,we want to enquire that since our company has its own product which uses Flash technology but its been known now that firefox will not suppport adobe flash player after  2020.
So if we save and continue to use an oder version of firefox(with autoupdate off),will it allow to continue usage of Adobe Flash Player after 2020?
Please confirm the same or any other workaround so that adobe flash player can be used within firefox after 2020 as well.

It looks like I can successfully log in, but once I am redirected to my account web page the screen goes blank.  When I called royal bank they told me it is related to how Firefox's enhanced blocking protection is causing this.  I have created an exemption to exclude <a href=""http://royalbank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">royalbank.com</a> and associated domains from these FireFox protections, but sadly this is not working.
I have also confirmed that I can successfully access my <a href=""http://royalbank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">royalbank.com</a> account using Internet Explorer and Chrome and so definitely this is a Fire fox issue.  Hopefully this issue will be elevated to the FireFox team so that it can be resolved in a further release.
