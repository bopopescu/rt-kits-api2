I want it to autosave most passwords, and it had been doing that fine. Then I noticed saved passwords were being rejected by sites, and when I clicked on 'view' to see what the saved password was that had been autofilled, it wouldn't be right. It would be a different login and password for a previous site. For instance, firefox was trying to autofill my college login with my personal email and a different password, not my .edu email. I haven't changed any behavior or gone into settings or done anything that seems likely to trigger this issue. Also can't find anything about it in search. Any ideas?

A Forum I use extensively suddenly started showing content layed out in a sort of linear fashion where everything was set onto a new line.
I have used this forum for more than 18 years and this is the first time this has happened,
The site is a respected one, and a search for 'MSDN Forum' would provide a link(s) to my problem site.
After a LOT of work trying to find what has happened has resulted in my finding that scripts and CSS seem to be skipped from being loaded by Firefox reporting the error message I mention in the title. These errors are MANY thoughout the incoming data.
I subsequently tried to pursue Mozilla articles on Mixed Content Blocking, which seems to say Ishould have an option to 'disable' Firefox security with respect to the above via clicking on the 'sheild' icon and follow through to where there is supposed to be am option to 'stop/disble' - but there is no such option here so I can't check if that option is a cause of my issue.
This issue is very severe as it disable ALL of the needed buttons - such as Reply, Quote and Post New Question - for a Forum, that is indeed severe!
Now, I don't know if this whole issue is a fault with either Microsoft (who seem to be serving faulty data, or, Firefox for being overly coseting)
I attach an image showing a portion of the errors (they extend throughout the entire list).
Patricularly, the line at the top saying the Style Sheet could not be loaded summarizes the whole issue. Is there any other way I can get to disable Firefox being overly protective - I do know how to use the About:Config etc., but lack the ability to find anything relevant to this issue in any of the content there.
</p><p>A further snippet of information: amongst other things, I reinstalled Window 10 and used Edge immediately after install had completed - same issues (suggesting that either both browsers are overly protective, or that the issues stem from Microsoft). I have tried most/all of the things likely to be suggested here suxh as using Safe Mode, no Extensions etc.
</p><p>To save readers from becoming bored with this long essay, I'll stop here - if further info needed, just ask.

It was like that for a year or so and I didn't care much about it, but today marks the sad day when I realized it was just Firefox and developers just let it be, for such a long time.

What should I do?","<p>Firefox did an automatic update and totalled my old Firefox, or so I thought.  I deleted Old Firefox.  I downloaded new Firefox.  Old Firefox reappeared with bookmarks, but New Firefox also appeared without bookmarks.  I am completely mystified as to what I should do.  Delete new Firefox and continue to use old Firefox? Or is there some way to install new Firefox and keep my old bookmarks on which I rely?  I find this unfortunate migration disturbing and am wondering what went wrong and what else is wrong with new Firefox and the migration process.  Thanks to anyone who can help me on this.

It is saying that it is a security issue. And thanks to google header which is strict transport security it will not load.
