This is no longer possible with FireFox 64 bits ... which forces us to use Edge (which we do not like)...  Since EMA may take a lot of time to convert its web sites for using HTML 5 and stop using Adobe Flash Player, we do need an alternative for FireFox ...  
Is there any that Mozilla would recommend ?

</p><p>Sou usuário do Firefox desde quando ingressei no mundo digital, o Firefox sempre foi minha janela preferida. Entretanto, existe uma configuração em específico que já pesquisei incansavelmente a solução e não encontrei. É algo que realmente me incomoda e eu gostaria de personalizar o Firefox o suficiente pra fazer esta alteração.
</p><p>A alteração: fixar a porcentagem do zoom de página para todas as páginas (67%), sem a necessidade de ficar ajustando toda vez que visito qualquer página, que eu já tinha visitado antes ou não. E que a personalização fique gravada no navegador, para assim não ter a necessidade de ficar ajustando toda vez que fechar/abrir o navegador.
</p><p>Assim como existem as pessoas com problemas de visão e precisam de letras grandes, há o outro lado da moeda, que é o meu. :(
</p><p>Por favor, me dê alguma orientação relacionada ao problema.
Desde já, agradeço!

But, with the next Firefox restart that installs the update 73 the problem reappears. I have also checked to see if Firefox runs in compatibility mode but it didn't. Please help me solve this issue.

The stopping point changes randomly if I close and reopen Firefox. If I click just past the stopping point, it will continue to play, until the next stop and back to start again. Back then I used to blame the bad implement from host sites and/or bad connections, but for the last few days, out of curiosity, I tried chrome and did not get a single stop like Firefox. I also tested the same streaming link (m3u8) on VLC and it played perfectly. It was like that for a year or so and I didn't care much about it, but today marks the sad day when I realized it was just Firefox and developers just let it be, for such a long time. I appreciate any help configuring firefox to fix it, if possible, but this should not happen at default. For the time being, I jumped on the chrome boat despite being a Firefox fan from version 4 or so(2006). I used to pressure everyone I know into using firefox, now I feel bad about it. I hope Firefox get better soon.

</p><p>It takes way too much time to tweak the configuration of a frequently used program such as a Web broswer only to have the whole damn thing revert to stock settings whenever an upgrade comes along.
</p><p>I can see why many settings or installed add-ons might not work if a particular upgrade involved many significant changes to FF, but users should be given the choice of not upgrading and never Syncing Firefox until they are sure that all the perceived bugs in the upgrade that break things they like as-is I like are fixed and that Syncing will not do more harm than good from their perspective.
</p><p>Newer or allegedly ""improved"" is not automatically better in the eues of the owner/user.  Just look at the millions of people who have avoided downgrading their Windows 7 or 8 installtions to Windows 10.  The latter seems even more defective by design.
</p><p>Why cannot FF be upgraded without breaking much of what users found good in the previous version, often due to their customizations?  I wonder if the upgrades could be done on a feature/function basis in most cases.  I certainly understand why the upgrade to FF Quantum had to be an all or nothing procedure...but EVERY upgrade since then?!?

Firefox had no right to impose the verification email without letting the customer make sure his email can still recieve verification codes. Firefox failed to provide customer support because it doesnt even have a technical support email or phone number like a registered business should have.
