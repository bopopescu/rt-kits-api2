I have this problem once every few years, So far I havent managed to set up anythng that works reliably to get me out of the mess.
I use FF and have over 1000 tabs. 99% of the time 'restore session from before' after reboot works automatically great.  Obviously with that many tabs things slow down, I then use CCLEANER to clear up and reboot.Today I forgot I had mutliple unimportant firefox windows open in addition to my MOTHERLOAD firefox window. I closed my session in perhaps some haphazzard order. On restarting I only had my unimportant windows open. 
I have not restarted after this Im still sitting in the new session.
I have yet to find a consistent way to backup my open tabs. In the past I had an addon which wrote my tabs to a file but that addon got dumped after an update to FF.
I REALLY REALLY dont want to lose my list of tabs as I wont be able to get this info back
But more that this what is the safest way to back this info up on a regular basis in a way that I can get back to it? The current way is not 100% foolproof. :(
</p><p>I have no history showing in FF as CCleaner removes all that (session data isnt removed). I assume I might have restore or previous restore files? Really not sure where to look. Im on Windows 10. Im not even sure where to look anymore for the sessonrestore file. Perhaps it doesnt save it when it isnt the last window to be closed??? Im reluctant to close this session now too. (Hope all my terminology is correct. Is it a window has mutiple tabs, you can have more than one window all of which comprise the session.)

But now I get this yellow banner saying The plugin has crashed, two option send crash report (which I have done) and reload. Reloading does the same. I have disabled all the plugins and made sure that the widewine add on is enabled.
I also used the refreshed option and started in safe mode. I also unistalled fire fox and deleted the local profile for firefox.
Still same issue. 
Next opened in a private window still same problem.
Logged out of my firefox account same issue. 
I am scratching my head. Happy to fully remove all Firefox settings/cache 100% from the machine to start from scratch but see above I had thought I have done this. (in linux the profile is /home/username/.mozilla/)
