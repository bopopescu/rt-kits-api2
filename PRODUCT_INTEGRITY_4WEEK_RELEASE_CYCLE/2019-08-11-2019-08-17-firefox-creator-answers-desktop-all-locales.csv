</p><p>I have done similar tests uploading the same file to youtube, vimeo and running the backblaze bandwidth test, as well as <a href=""http://speedof.me"" rel=""nofollow"">speedof.me</a>.  They all show firefox trailing behind by the same margins. 
</p><p>Where I seem to see no difference however, is the Ookla speed test as in that case firefox tests about as high as chrome. 
</p><p>I've tried reinstalling, safe mode and refresh. No extensions are on and I only run windows defender on Windows 10 (up to date updates). 
</p><p>I spent the end of the afternoon calling my ISP thinking they were throttling traffic only to realize it's only firefox.  Attaching a screen shot of Backblaze Bandwidth test and <a href=""http://speedof.me"" rel=""nofollow"">speedof.me</a> that I happen to test in two different browsers when I first noticed the discrepancy. I seem to be pegged to the 65Megabit limit in my practical upload tests to youtube, google drive, and vimeo.

1266862,2019-08-16 12:35:03 -0800,2019-10-30T16:04:08Z,Need help on reducing bookmarks line spacing,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>First of all, I would like to say that I am a Firefox user since 2007 (since we are in 2019, that's 12 years).
I like it and I thank all the Firefox people that worked on it.
</p><p>However, about two weeks ago I have updated my system from Debian 8 to Debian 10; and with it came a new version of Firefox.
</p><p>And I don't like the way this new Firefox version looks:
- it's ugly 
- it has out of proportion line spacing in the bookmarks
- it has out of proportion line spacing in the Preferences menus
- it is much less visual appealing than previous versions
</p><p>Nevertheless, under the hood, I don't doubt that it is more advanced and better.
</p><p>I just think it's a wrong move from the people leading Firefox at the moment.
Maybe they believe they have to follow the (stupid) trend that many other software houses are following: 
- non intuitive icons
- poor use of colors
- exagerated simplifying in icons design
- minimalistic screen organization
- menus with less options, forcing the users to edit configuration files
</p><p>All this leads to the user having to ""try and guess"", trying to discover how things work.
20 or 10 years ago, the softwares weren't so advanced, but they were more organized and with better menus.
Today, if seems the need is to build something beautiful.
But that beauty soon loses it charm after 5 minutes of interaction.
</p><p>This is the sensation I get from interacting with Firefox nowadays.
And it extends to the support forum, with lack of tast in the design, colors, etc.
Too many steps back, in my opinion.
</p><p>Using Firefox now is not as good an experience like it was some years ago.
We need something that works, that has good menus, that we like to see.
And not being forced to like something that others think it's the present trend.
Firefox is used for the internet, so it needs to be a very good tool.
Stop fooling around with it, please.
</p><p>Also, when I try to solve this problem using themes, I'm stumped because I find some many themes.
But the problem is that they are poor quality themes.
Much quantity, but poor quality.
And the search function, is horrible to say the least.
</p><p>Besides, I don't understand that Firefox now calls themes to simply adding an image to the menu bar.
Is that really a theme?
Is this really a good service?
I don't think so.
I think this is dumb.
And steers users away.
</p><p>I don't care for flowers or manga characters in my menu bar.
I just want well designed folder icons and line spacing that makes sense.
</p><p>Why doesn't Firefox gives the user the choice of using the previous themes?
Aren't we in 2019?
Something like: Menu - Tools - Themes:
- Firefox 55 theme
- Firefox 56 theme
- Firefox 57 theme
[..]
- Firefox xx theme
</p><p>Can you imagine how many hours are you wasting from your millions of users that use Firefox to work and would benefit of something like this?
</p>
<h6 id=""w_"">================================================</h6>
<p>Having said this, now I present my goal with this post:
I would like to know:
- how can I reduce bookmarks line spacing?
</p><p>I use Firefox to work everyday.
I need it to be functional.
I have thousands of bookmarks and I have organized them so they fit my screen.
</p><p>Right now, I am losing much time scrolling up and down within my bookmark folders, because this new version of Firefox has a bigger line spacing than the version I used before.
</p><p>Please see the attached picture.
</p><p>Thank you.

They are different subject versions, not copies  or editions of each other. Depending on which version I am using at the time, Firefox would routinely backup either version, and it can be seen in the Profile. Either version is also visible as a function of time and size, if I want to restore them. When I manually back either version up I do so to a separate folder in ""documents"". There has been no problems for over two years until today. I backed up Version A at 10:00 manually and Firefox also shows one at 10:06. Normal. At 10:15 I restored version B which naturally overwrites version A. Worked fine, as it has in the past. I edited version B using Firefox ""show all bookmarks"". On finishing I selected backup&gt;chose file&gt; version B and nothing happened. So I tried export to HTML with file name - nothing happened. I selected a book mark to open in new tab and it worked. I tried to delete the bookmark, and it would not delete. I can see that my account is synching and has been for about two hours.  This practice of alternating bookmarks version has worked without a hitch for a very long time.   
</p><p>I am concerned that if I exit FireFox the effort to edit the version B bookmarks will be lost because it is not in profile folder and not able to manually back up. Suggestions?

I've been using Firefox for many years and i never had any trouble with it.
But now i have trouble.
I had to format my pc and start from scratch with win 10.
Before that i saved my Firefox bookmarks.
Installed win 10 and all updates for win 10.
Got the newest version of Firefox, and installed it.
Went to ""Import &amp; Backup bookmarks"", and clicked import. Now Firefox freezes and had to be closed down.
Whenever i click on anything in ""Import &amp; Backup bookmarks"" it freezes. and i can see it uses a lot of Cpu usage (High CPU usage)
I Tried to follow the guides for  (High CPU usage) but that didn't help, i reinstalled Firefox, i deleted the profile, start in Fail safe mode nothing helped.
I spent hours looking in guides, but couldn't find anything that helped.
Can anyone here help me

</p><p>The easy answer, of course, is to call up HP and tell them to rewrite the console code - or tell the system owner to toss out his servers and buy new ones .... and of course, learn never EVER to buy a Tripp Lite product.

A mentett kép ikonja a standard png, jpg, stb. ikon, nem a képfájl tartalma jelenik meg.
- ugyanez úgy is fennáll, ha a képet direkt (listából választva) png (stb.) formátumban mentem. A mentett fájl png vagy jpg kiterjesztéssel kerül a desktopra, de nem olvasható.

Things mostly work, but sometimes they don't. The things that don't work seem to be buttons and menus. I run Firefox on Linux; today I'm on Fedora 28 with Firefox 66.0.4, but my issues seem to transcend time- probably 8 years or more. But Chrome scares me, so maybe we can address this and get it figured out.

After you get there, a New Coupon windows pops up. Apparently ""Coupon in Your Pocket"" is a button, but nothing happens when I click on it.
</p><p>I've been having problems at Aliexpress, too, where it asks me to login but I can't because the login button is unresponsive. But let's not try to fix Aliexpress, perhaps it would be better to focus on the one website so we don't get distracted. And it's easy- just go to it and the coupon will pop up.
</p><p>I've had problems on other websites that I can't recall right now. But this <a href=""http://lcsc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">lcsc.com</a> problem seems to be pretty straightforward, so I decided to report it in the hopes that I can get Firefox to work once and for all.

</p><p>Main problems at the moment:
My address bar in Firefox54 shows lots of options.  They disappeared when I upgraded.
In Firefox54, when I open multiple tabs, they open on their own ""line"".  In Firefox68, all I see is a ""floater"" with one tab. I want all my tabs to show at the ""bottom"". (I use tabmixplus).
</p><p>I have tried to upload images but it just ""circles and circles""
</p><p>So let me try to describe Firefox54:
Top line: oldstyle menu (File, Edit .....Help)
Next line:  address bar  search bar pocket googleoptions home ......
Next line:  bookmarks
Next line: Prefbar
Bottom line:  open tabs
</p><p>Firefox68:
Top line: old style menu (File, Edit, View, ...)
Next Line: address bar &amp; search bar and that silly 3bars to show the menu.  (everything else has disappeared)
Next Line: bookmarks  (all OK)
</p><p>That's it. Even when I load multiple tabs, all I see is a tab that ""floats"" over the address bar &amp; if I open multiple tabs, they seem to partially ""hide"" behind the menu area so I can vaguely see them behind the bookmarks &amp; address bar - which is very disconcerting

I have a problem logging in to my Firefox Sync account.
I've set up 2-step login before.
When logging in, a 6-digit code from the authentication application is
required. Unfortunately, there is still information that the code you
entered is incorrect.
I have changed the password, but the error with the code still appears.
Unfortunately, after changing the computer, I do not have a recovery key.
Is it possible to delete my account so that I can create it again?
I have already accepted the loss of data, but I care about the address

First my congrats on FF overall of course, to you and your many volunteers.  But I notice a large philosophical programming problem which you might consider.
</p><p>This problem mostly shows with multiple tabs open.  Web servers certainly are slow, and many pages' Html etc poor.  This all results in lots of delays such as reported during:
</p><pre> Waiting for ()
 Read ()
 Transferring data from ()
 Performing a TLS handshake to ()
 Connecting to ()
</pre>
<p>These display the moving ""working"" dot in the left of the affected tab title.  And less often, ""(not responding)"" in FF's title bar, which eventually gets cleared automatically.
</p><p>I have reviewed all 17 screens, and a number of the individual results, from today's FF forum search of:
</p><pre>  169 results for (not responding) for Firefox
</pre>
<p>None address the lack of prioritized co-operative multi-tasking/ threading, DURING such delays as ""Waiting for ()"".  During such a necessary wait, it is very slow at best, e.g. for a user to switch tabs.  Even to one which is ready for display.
</p><p>Responsiveness to user input should be the top multi-tasking priority.  Tab switching.  Rendering/ display of the foreground tab.  Scrolling that down.  Tab closing by user!, and ""X"" to STOP a page from loading -- give those user clicks priority.  Let's not have to wait 10 seconds for a right-click to open its option box.  Let the other busy tabs finish up their work, overlapped in the background priority-wise.
</p><p>This could be done now, but perhaps it would be difficult for volunteer programmers.  Worse case might require a custom replacement, for the effective TCP part of the default vanilla TCP/IP stack.  However I suspect a lot could be fixed short of that, with the correct management encouragement and guidelines.  At least if the continuous motion of the ""busy dot"" indicator in the tab title is a task, just change that to something like just gray-ed out while busy.
</p><p>My experience is with much headroom:  CPU (50%), memory, disk, and network bandwidth, per Task Manager.  NO McAfee.  Mainly just ZoneAlarm taking 30% of that CPU 50% usage.  This is not a problem with start-up delay.  And delays within only one open tab are necessary, of course.  Cheers

How-to can I disable the policy for My Personal FireFox ? ?,"<p>I usually use and update my PortableApps version of FireFox, that runs from my Thumb/Flash drive, at the Public Library network's workstation due to my use of their facilities for research.  
The Library uses this same version of FireFox on each of their workstation, too.  About three weeks ago, PortableApps indicated that FireFox had an Update to version 68 ready for my copy of FireFox to use.  I accepted to update My Personal copy of FireFox to this version while using the Library's workstation running Windows 7.  
Now when I startup my personal copy of FFox from my PortableApps Flash drive, I immediately noticed that INSTEAD of showing the Home page that I had chosen many years ago and was still using, it had changed to the Library's selected Starting Webpage, as if I was starting FFox or Chrome from THEIR installed software ON this workstation (please see -- the attachment showing the Grayed-out selection about the Home Page).  
I have contacted PortableApps via IRC and they confirmed that they do not effect the installation of FFox other than install upon the logically identified drive as the target device.  They felt that there was some background process running and this process might have applied an Enterprise Policy file to this installation process.  They then suggested contacting Mozilla's support. 
I would like to properly address this change and also see what other preferences may have been affected.  I have posted this Question due to having been hurt by using a Generic solution (in the Past) described for a similar but not the same issue (i.e. How to Disable the Enterprise Roots Preference).  
Reading a bit further, there seems to be two methods of accomplishing this type of control (MS's - Group Policy -or- a policy.json file).  
In the meantime, I thought that I would seek Mozilla's Support more specific advise and help.  
I find this VERY annoying considering, I am using my personal version of software and they Only recently ( after using their network for years ) affected my copy without ANY notice posted on their network of this type of change for my consideration.  
My benefit to the use of a my personal copy is to be able to save found sites to My - Bookmarks/Favorites.  Otherwise I would not have this ability, but with notices, I would have found either other public networks or methods to have this functionality years ago. 
</p><p>I hope that someone may have a better process of figuring out how and what to do to in these types of situations.  Also what would be the best way to protect an otherwise operating Browser - Say backing up, What ! ? Prior to making changes ?  Thanks ahead of time !

<p>5a.Tech. Support department at [financial website] 1st: told me they had made NO Changes to encryption on their server, and 2nd: they have AntiVirus + Internet Security on their server that most likely rejects my older computer (even with up-to-date INet Security definitions). 
</p><pre> b. A Mac shop cleaned malware from my Mac, but found NONE.  They suggested that some websites are now requiring one of 'only the 3 most recent versions of an O.S.,' which is supported by updates from its manufacturer, in order to connect to their server.

<p>6a. I can't find any items in my Mac's hard drive relating to a FrFx/Mozilla Extension, as that folder won't open, even with administrative rights.  (But Can't Log-In as Admin.-User with missing Password.)  Can any ....plist s be removed safely and v. 48.0.2 function well?
</p><pre> b. ****How can one find + remove the added extension,, or whatever, at that memory-key stated in the FrFx-History-Menu?*****
 c. Is there a newer ver. of Firefox browser which can now be installed safely on OSX 10.6.8?

I'm guessing the person who made that decision was strictly a coder who never used styled text.  :?)  Is there a way to change it to something else? Thanks!

I also use Cookie 5 for management of cookies and noticed it was not deleting Firefox cookies, but still worked with other browsers. I worked with <a href=""http://sweetpproductions.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sweetpproductions.com</a> to see if Cookie 5 had an issue but nothing found. Essentially, if I wipe out Firefox entirely ( I went as far as creating a new Firefox Sync account) things work for a while. Problems start to show up in this order:
1. No suggestions from my history when typing in the address bar
2. Old bookmarks show up, ones that have not existed in the new Sync account (I did, however restore my bookmarks from a clone of my SSD made a couple of weeks ago, so they may have been somewhere in there)
3. Cannot delete these old bookmarks
4. Export bookmarks to html creates a file with only folder titles, no links at all (I tried this to see if I could edit out the unwanted bookmarks there and re-import)
5. Export bookmarks to html fails altogether; no file is written
6. Cookie stops being able to read and delete Firefox cookies. The new cookies arrive, can be seen in my Privacy prefs, but don't show in Cookie 5.
</p><p>Most of this sounds like places.sqlite is becoming corrupted. I don't think that is affected by Cookie 5, as I understand it stores only history and bookmarks. I'm waiting to hear from SweetP to confirm Cookie 5 doesn't touch places.sqlite. I suppose I must try to confirm this by starting over again and keeping a copy of places.sqlite when it is fresh, then using it to replace the file in my profile when the problems start. To save time, I plan to try first to replace it with a copy from yesterday from a TimeMachine backup.
</p><p>I'd be delighted to have any advice you can offer. In the last few days I have set up just about every other browser for Mac I can find and only Vivaldi comes close to Firefox (but when that Vivaldi Helper starts eating up my CPU things get hot and the fans run. I can't live with that!)

1266485,2019-08-10 21:06:14 -0800,2019-08-10T22:20:52Z,Firefox slow to start and responding to shortcuts,"<p>Hello,
This issue started a month or two ago. Previously, Firefox takes about 1 second to start. The next day, starting my computer, Firefox consistently takes about 5-10 seconds to start. Not only this, but it also takes 5-10 seconds for an already running Firefox to respond to links from external programs (e.g. Adobe Acrobat, Word), as well as opening a second Firefox window by clicking on the Firefox shortcut. Interestingly, everything is fast and smooth with normal browsing and opening a new window via Firefox Ctrl+N is fine. Other browsers and software have no issues (e.g. Chrome). This has been really frustrating as I'm heavily reliant on Firefox and I have tried the following methods to no avail:
</p><p>• Disabling all add-ons / Start Firefox in Safe Mode
• Reinstalling Firefox with fresh / no profiles.
• Disabling anti-virus software (ESET Internet Security)
• Uninstalling anti-virus software
• Flushing DNS and resetting adapter
• [WORKED] Starting Windows in Safe Mode
• Disabling start-up services and processes systematically without Windows Safe Mode [Firefox slow again]
• Disabling all services [still slow]
• [WORKED for a few days...] Clean reinstalling WINDOWS
• [WORKED for a few days...] System Restore (in between restore points I did almost nothing to PC, did not install any new programs, etc.)
</p><p>Sounds like a software issue, but if you want specs:
Intel 7700K, 16GB 3000MHz RAM, Z270, Nvidia 980 Ti, Crucial M500 SSD.
</p><p>What are your thoughts? To me, it seems like something that run in normal Windows mode is slowing Firefox to start. Possibly conflicting apps? But I couldn't figure out which. Obviously, I can't run Windows in Safe mode all the time, so I was wondering if you have a solution?
</p><p>Many thanks
Cam

It always allowed access from the Menu Bar under Edit. Now I have to access them from my System Preferences which is located on my Dock and requires many steps which are a huge inconvenience. I know it sounds silly but it shouldn't be like this and never was. Safari still has theirs in the Menu Bar so what happened? Did this happen to everyone or just me? lol
