1264562,1563031315,1563201732,The star icon menu is clunky,"<p>I switched to Firefox a couple of years ago when Quantum came out. I'm satisfied with it but the main reason I keep using it is grounded on ethics rather than usability (which is fine for me but won't win the stone hearts of more cynical users :-)  ). I had this sort of superficial opinion: ""Chrome is better, but I don't want to use it."" Today I wanted to give Chromium another try. I thought about what it is that makes it better and figured out it almost completely boils down to the star icon functionality: I'm a heavy bookmarks user and Firefox makes me slow, compared to Chrome.
</p><p>First, it doesn't use the latest location in which I saved a bookmark as a default (this was also requested, not by me, on <a href=""http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;p=14770920)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;p=14770920)</a>. I often add a row of pages to a single bookmarks folder, but rather than selecting the tabs and adding all of them at once by dragging and dropping as Firefox allows, I prefer to check them on by one: add one, close it, take a look at the one that follows, either close it right away or add it, and so on. In Chrome it's done with a couple of shortcuts in quick succession, in Firefox its much clunkier because one needs to set the directory every time.
</p><p>Then a really annoying and sort of antiquated-feeling characteristic of Firefox's star icon menu and bookmarks sidebar is that type-ahead motion in it (when I type the first letters of the name I want to move to) breaks on spaces. This kind of motion is the only one that is practical once one has a few hundred directories, but if I have a list of directories like ... ""The Rolling Stones"", ""The Who""... I can only match up to ""The"" then I'm on my own.
</p><p>These flaws slow down the menial job of adding bookmarks a lot. Other things that could bring an improvement in my opinion would be an ""Open in folder"" context menu item for bookmarks search results, and the possibility to restrict searches to defined folders. I think what I've described should be done natively and not by extensions.
</p><p>Keep up the good work and thanks for what you do.

1264552,1563018826,1563053236,"Firefox 68.0 making multiple processes in the Task Manager, can't disable them at all.","<p>After Firefox updated to 68.0 the other day, I have found myself being plagued by it making multiple processes in the Task Manager yet again.
I have already tried the following:
</p><p>1) Already tried about:config to change browser.tabs.remote.autostart.2/browser.tabs.remote.autostart from true to false. It is set, but absolutely nothing has changed.
</p><p>2) I have tried going into Options&gt;Performance and limiting the Content Process Limit to 1 instead of 4. The setting was saved, and yet it has not changed a thing.
</p><p>3) Ending these processes only results in my tabs crashing, and reloading them only adds another Firefox process. 
</p><p>But as it turns out here: <a href=""https://www.ghacks.net/2019/05/17/going-forward-multi-process-cant-be-turned-off-anymore-in-firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ghacks.net/2019/05/17/going-forward-multi-process-cant-be-turned-off-anymore-in-firefox/</a>
Firefox has removed the option to turn this off entirely after updating.
</p><p>My computer can't handle having more than 1 Firefox process open and I want to disable multiple processes, otherwise everything will lag horribly. Is there any way I can permanently disable the multiple processes?

1264550,1563016930,1563062152,Student calendar on https://myportal.unitec.ac.nz/ displays my classes 12 hours earlier than they are.,"<p>My student calendar on <a href=""https://myportal.unitec.ac.nz/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myportal.unitec.ac.nz/</a> displays my classes 12 hours earlier than they are. I have checked and the timezone on my laptop is definitely set to the correct timezone. I did a search and discovered that this problem could be because I have privacy.resistFingerprinting set to true and therefore my browser is giving the timezone UTC. I checked this via the browser console. I am in New Zealand so my timezone is 12 hours ahead of UTC so hence the 12 hour difference.
</p><p>I am mentioning this here as I didn't want to bother the folks on Bugzilla until I knew for sure that it was a bug. So I'm asking, is this the expected behaviour for users that have privacy.resistFingerprinting set to true? or is this a bug? I am pretty sure that this problem did not exist earlier in the week when I was running Firefox Developer Edition 69.0b3 (64-bit) (Mac OS); I am now running 69.0b4 and this is when the problem seems to have popped up. So I'm just asking if this is what I should expect if wanting to prevent browser fingerprinting?
</p><p>The calendar is only viewable for users that are logged in, unfortunately.
