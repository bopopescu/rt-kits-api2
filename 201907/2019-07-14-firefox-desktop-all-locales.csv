When the themes were not animating the appearance of the theme page differed from when the themes were working.
</p><p>Attachment 1 shows the theme page when the theme is enabled and working. Attachment 2 shows the theme page appearance when it is not working. Clicking on the 3 dots on the bottom right (when they are not working) takes you into the settings for the theme but there is no way of re-activating the animation.
</p><p>I have found the only way of re-activating the animation in all of the animated themes I have is to do a system restore back to 10th July 2019. This is not practical to do  every time I close down my computer and re-open it to find my animated theme not working.
</p><p>If I do a system restore and get the animated themes working and log out of Firefox the themes will not be working when I log in again in the same working session on my PC.
