1264530,1562973361,1562976380,Firefox no longer supports -p option for starting profiles,"<p>I have been using the -p option to create and start Firefox profiles for years.
This used to allow me to run multiple Firefox windows with different profiles using bash scripts that were all symlinks to the same file. Today I find that if I want to use multiple profiles simultaneously, I have to
1. Use about:profiles to get the profile manager
2. Find the profile I need
3. Click a button to start a new window with the profile I need.
Compared to running a bash script, this takes a lot more time. I don't see a good reason for trading the command line option for this new system.
After reading the documented command line options at
<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Command_Line_Options</a>
it appears that I'm supposed to use ""-new-instance"". However, I never had to do that before the most recent update. After some experimentation, It appears that ""-new-instance"" is ignored. After looking around, it appears that the latest Firefox update broke ""-p"" on macOS. A workaround is to use ""-no-remote -P"", but I'm left wondering why the need to break something that has worked for many years.

</p><p>I'm pretty good with computers but haven't delved into the nuances of userChrome.css, and I *think* that's where my solution lies.
</p><p>Background: due to something I can't nail down in my security settings, the Instapaper plugin isn't able to function as intended, but I discovered that I was able to get the Javascript bookmarklet to behave. Good deal--one less plugin to drain my system. HOWEVER, I'm one of those nerds who keeps oft-used links in the toolbar with the text removed. That means this link has the generic globe for an icon--and I really want the Instapaper I as a visual cue.
</p><p>I've been digging around online trying to find the solution, but while I've gotten as far as determining that I need to tell FF what icon to use in a userChrome.css file--none of the info I'm finding quite matches up with the variables I have to provide. I don't understand how to specify the bookmarklet without using the name field (as it's blank). When I try using the full Javascript string bad things happen, and I'm not sure how to explain wildcards within the context so I could just use ""<a href=""http://instapaper.com"" rel=""nofollow"">instapaper.com</a>"" or something.
</p><p>I am so frustrated by this seemingly easy task! Plus, I'm used to being able to do some searching and sort things out. Not this time... brain hurts! Can someone please show me what the code snippet to accomplish this looks like? 
</p><p>I don't care if the ICO is remote or sits in the chrome folder locally.
