Like for some reason when I'm browsing, the pictures on the top of results load up at the top correctly but when I go down the results page and click on any picture, the page starts half way down passed the picture and near the comments. I don't think web pages are supposed to start from the middle of the webpage when you load it up.

It is run on my laptop. I have an external monitor and I have dragged a Firefox window over to that external monitor.
</p><p>When I click on a link in Thunderbird, the link opens up in the secondary window, not the primary window on my laptop where I have most of my pages open in.
</p><p>What I would like to happen is to have the links open in the primary window.
</p><p>Should I file a bug report and ask Mozilla to add a feature that allows the user to right click on a window and make that window the primary window? This would be helpful to me.
</p><p>Is there a way around this? Is there anything I can do about it? Or should I file a new bug report as a feature request?
</p><p>I see someone else has asked a similar question but their question is the opposite as in they want to have the links opened in the secondary window: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1252876"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1252876</a>

In Windows Explorer, these folders appear under Mozilla.  How can I tell which folder is what and are they all important to have and backup?  Of course I know one of them saves your browser related activity.  Even though the folders are a bit dated, the data in some are somewhat recent within past, say, year?  Do I keep all?
</p><p>If you open these folders they are have random file dates from a couple of years ago to today.  I am running the layest version of FF Windows.
</p><p>Thanks for your help!

Now I turn off Ublock once in a while as I've learned it may be causing FF to give me the ""page not found/server"" error page. 
</p><p>Seems to me by using Sync FF should be able to keep Tops sites where they should be and keep them pinned. Make no sense to me.
</p><p>Anyhow, trying to read the How to fix preferences page but I gotta hang it up and get some sleep.

Thanks for any input. Hopefully the .js solution will work w/o hosing any Add-ons, etc.
