Since Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection is based on lists from Disconnect as I've read, does that mean that when Disconnect updates, so to does ETP?  Or does ETP slowly learn over time about new trackers and block those (like how Privacy Badger works?)
I currently have ETP set to Strict, but I also have Disconnect, Privacy Badger, Privacy Possum, and DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials as addon supplements.
If this has been answered already, sorry for the repeat question.

I frequently make this and other typing errors when using the browser, because i have to look at the keyboard when typing quickly and rely on the spellcheck to highlight the times when my fingers are not so well coordinated.
At first, i thought it was a Facebook issue, but it appears on other sites where i make manual inputs.
