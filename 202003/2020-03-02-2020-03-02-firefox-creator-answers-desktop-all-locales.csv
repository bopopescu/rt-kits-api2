While a great tool, I believe the companies can benefit as well. Most users have laptops. Laptops leave the confines of the office regularly. Why not have laptops configured so that they point to a companies DNS infrastructure when not in the office? The benefit would be that any filtering/monitoring being done via DNS no longer is limited to when devices are on the company network!
</p><p>This would require companies exposing DNS to the internet which is considered a bad idea. DNS will expose internal secrets and let the bad guys probe the architecture of the network for information they can use later. Adding authentication to the DoH solution would allow companies to leverage their internal certificate infrastructure and already deployed client certificates to protect that DNS information.
</p><p>TLS mutual auth via client certificates is part of the SSL/TLS protocol already in use by DoH and there is nothing in the RFC to prevent this from being a possibility.
</p><p>Is this something that can be added to the roadmap (or is it already on the roadmap)?

Along the course of the years, I found out that inverting the text-background colors is a good practice to reduce the eye-straining and increase my reading speed. 
</p><p>To achieve this in Firefox, I installed ""Dark Background Light Text"" add-on and it I used to work out extremely good.
However, in June 2018 (Firefox 61) this add-on lost the priviledge to operate in the embedded PDF viewer.  This is extremely painful (considering that on average I open 40-50 PDF per week), and I often I have to download/open the documents outside Firefox. This often turns out to be a disrupting process, that makes me lose focus when swapping back and forth between the PDF viewer, my IDE and the browser.
</p><p>I don't know whether there is a way to activate this feature and I think I made a couple of requests to implement it, but, as of now,  I've never received any answer. What makes things worse the Firefox's PDF viewer is the __only__ viewer that doesn't support this feature natively. Is there a way to enable this in Firefox? (I could be as desperate as to try to volunteer to implementing it in the code myself)

</p><p>i'm well aware of how you guys left the old firefox memory leak issue unresolved for well over 2 decades until eventually coming up with that ""tab unloader"" feature as the solution.
</p><p>i'm also aware that this volume slider issue has been a problem for at least 2 years now... i really hope this isn't the memory leak all over again because i do not enjoy browsing the internet and randomly having to bring up volume mixer and turn down the volume because firefox decided to spawn a new volume slider for NO GOOD REASON and at FULL VOLUME no less!
</p><p>it's not funny. it serves NO good purpose. and tbph it's actually rather startling and unsettling at times because there is no way of knowing when it'll happen again.
</p><p>will it happen with the next youtube tab i open to watch a video? or will it happen after 2 normal youtube tabs? oh, or how about when i open a tab to watch a video, turn down the new volume slider then leave said tab to check or do something else for a moment and come back only to have the audio BACK at full blast and have to lower it AGAIN on yet aNOTHER volume slider?!
</p><p>note: while i used youtube as an example here this problem happens ALL across the internet on ANY website regardless of whether or not the audio is coming from a video player, audio player, or anything else like a fricking flash game of all things.
</p><p>the memory leak had a temporary fix where you could periodically reboot the browser. this? this is 100% random with NO way of predicting when or where it'll happen next. as for why i brought up the memory leak issue...easy comparison for a problem that went unresolved for MANY years.

This solution does NOT WORK for Firefox 73.0.1 (and probably later). 
The display, when I get to ""Show All Bookmarks"". and click ""Bookmarks Menu"" is NOT the same as what Firefox displays in Bookmarks/Favorites. I see only a SINGLE separator on this display, Where I see a double separator when I click the bookmarks while browsing.
For the uploaded image: On the left, following my instructions for the referenced question. On the right, the favorites menu while browsing.
For the Browsing bookmarks (right), you see a double separator between/below the in/out box icon of ""Other Bookmarks"" and above the Folder icon ""Other Bookmarks"". On the left you see only a Single separator or none in the same place. 
</p><p>I am using a double (mismatched) monitor setup. 1600x900 Portrait orientation to the left and 1920x1080 Landscape orientation as the main monitor. This creates some problems for editing screenshots.
I ended up with duplicates when I imported saved bookmarks onto a newly downloaded Firefox on this new computer.
