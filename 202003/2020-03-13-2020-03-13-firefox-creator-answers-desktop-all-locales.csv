I also installed Norton 360 as my virus and firewall service, which is slightly different from the Norton Internet Security I was using on the old computer.  I installed the Norton extension for its password manager on Firefox.  On the old computer, I became accustomed to signing in to the password manager every time I restarted Firefox, but now I have to first sign in to my Norton account before I can even see the password manager sign-in page.  I suspect that I haven't managed the exceptions for cookies, etc. properly, but a long chat with Norton support didn't succeed in getting rid of the double sign-in problem.  Anybody know how to fix this problem or what I should try?  I already made exceptions for what the Norton guy told me were the web addresses for the manager and the account.

1281944,2020-03-13 13:05:34 -0800,2020-03-14T09:34:28Z,"Firefox keeps turning ""cookies.sqlite"" into .bak since it updated to version 74.0","<p>Immediately after updating to version 74.0, I noticed Firefox had logged me out from all sites I usually am automatically logged into at the start of a session. 
It was not the first time I encountered this problem, as it had been happening at irregular intervals, and found that it was caused by firefox replacing the ""cookies.sqlite"" file in my profile folder with a new one, while also dubbing the old one ""cookies.sqlite.bak"".
I always resolved the problem by:
</p><p>-Closing Firefox
</p><p>-Deleting the recently created ""cookies.sqlite"" in my profile folder
</p><p>-Renaming ""cookies.sqlite.bak"" into ""cookies.sqlite""
</p><p>-(Usually) Creating a copy of the .bak file and keeping it in a folder as insurance, in case I found no recent .bak the next time it happened or it got corrupted somehow
</p><p>After doing this, upon starting firefox I would find all my cookies in place and myself logged in all sites I cared about (I set it up so that firefox restores a long-running, multi-windowed session at startup).
</p><p>On a side note, I was always able to know whether my ""cookies.sqlite"" file had been rewritten by checking its size: if it had been just created, it would always be 512 Kb; the backup .bak file is instead 1.50 Mb.
</p><p><br>
Onto the problem at hand: after updating to 74.0 and finding that I lost all cookies and logins, I repeated the process highlighted above, as usual. 
It didn't resolve the problem though: I still didn't recover any cookie even though I switched the ""good"" .bak file with the newly created ""cookies.sqlite"". Upon starting firefox, instead of loading my 1.50 Mb .sqlite it keeps immediately renaming it .bak and creating its own cookies.sqlite. 
I even tried using a slightly older .bak, one that I had successfully switched before: the result was the same.
</p><p>I am at my wits' end: I checked and tried various cookie and privacy settings, but since firefox updated it seems determined to shun my old cookie backup in favor of creating its own empty, useless file. There also doesn't seem to be any recent documentation on this problem I can find. I even considered opening and checking both .sqlite and .bak files for any obvious differences, but I'm afraid I just don't know how.
</p><p><br>
Those cookies are critical for my navigation. ""Major Annoyance"" wouldn't even begin to describe starting a session without those.

</p><p>I used Browserling to test FF (and Chrome, Safari and Opera) with different versions including the latest version and get the same result, cannot load the HTTPS site.
</p><p>When loading the site over HTTPS, but using the IP address instead of the hostname, FF throws a warning ""SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN"" as expected. After accepting risk and continue, FF throws PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR.
</p><p>I do believe the issue is on the Azure web app, so I run Qualys SSL Server Test against the web app, see links below for the report images (cannot upload the PDF file), can you review and point out if there is any encryption ciphers supported by the server, but not supported by FF, so I can follow up with Azure on this?
</p><p>Your assistance is greatly appreciated.
