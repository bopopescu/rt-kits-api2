Used @media print, options seemed to be ignored - can use view source all self contained. using relative width of media which seems to be ignored. Yes, Shrink to fit helps, but that leaves too much space on the bottom of page.

Additionally this started happening after loading my old profile into firefox, so another alternative is slowly passing all the site info to a new profile, Sync not saving current login info is kinda annoying but I guess its for privacy. </p>",download-and-install_1;firefox-740;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1299041;1299047;1299055;1299064;,gmspetalhouse
