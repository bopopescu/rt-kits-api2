Cuando quedó abierta la página del navegador, accedí a opciones, privacidad y seguridad, certificados, y no existe ningún certificado instalado. Es para mi un problema muy grave. Necesito restablecerlos todos.

To prevent preying eyes, we require clients to identify them selves using a client certificate. This used to work until a few weeks ago, but now we are having problems using firefox. It keeps stating a SSL_ERROR_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE_ALERT error, and we cannot accessing the pages.
</p><p>I have already added our Root CA and intermediate CA (used to sign the client certs) in both firefox and the windows certificate store, But the problem is not yet resolved.
</p><p>The subdomain is protected with a an Organization Validated certficate from an official CA authority. Apparently we are missing something, but i can't see what is causing this issue. 
</p><p>If i disable the requirement for a client certificate, the site is accessible, but that is not really an option here.

tried preferences/options but was not able to find any tool to get them back.
thanks in advance for providing some help to one who was born in the age of the vacuum tubes... ;-)

1282353,2020-03-19 02:50:18 -0800,2020-03-19T02:50:18Z,I have many (>50) tabs open in a window - and need a better & easier way to rearrange them than by mouse-dragging them,"<p>I keep many tabs open, as a part of many activities I work on, all within my primary-use window. Additional windows contain other secondary clusters of pending projects. When trying to rearrange my work (=tabs), dragging a tab with the mouse across 50 other tabs is quite cumbersome and difficult to find the right place to sort it into. I'm looking for an easy way, like in Powerpoints slide-sorter where you can see 50+ slides in a matrix grid layout, or in the Mac OS Finder, where you can see thumbnail pictures and rearrange them. Mouse-dragging is great and much appreciated, but has its limits when dragging the tab ""far"" across the tabs to a new location many tabs away.
Solutions would be most appreciated. Thanks. Robert.

This is a major privacy problem as perhaps you don't want the world to know you are studying how to seek legal or medical help etc with audio blasting out at max level.
</p><p>I don't know why this is so hard to manage since detecting loud audio isn't that difficult and it seems like browsers have all sort of hooks into media features of the operating systems they run on.
</p><p>Can't firefox take samples of the audio (we don't need advanced signal processing here), determine that it is blasting out, and kill it?
</p><p>In any case I have never been able to get any impact from autoplay settings other than to screw up my browsing experience so bad I have to reset to defauts to even manually play a video.
</p><p>Addins like no script are so restrictive they render browsing impossible.
