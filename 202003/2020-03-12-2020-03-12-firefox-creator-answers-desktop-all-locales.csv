I'm having an issue with your software and trying to get to your support bulletin board and all it does is take me round and round through the same set of menus giving me a bunch of pre-written articles.   Stop with this shit.  I want to ask a question, not read your stupid articles that don't apply.   This is your lazy attempt to avoid having to answer people.   You mask it under the idea that these ""articles"" will discuss common issue and how to fix them, but all it really does is distract people to the point that they give up.

I am having a problem with my bookmarks.   I am using Firefox 74.   If I bookmark a page it used to add it to my Bookmarks drop down.  Sometime ago it stopped working.   Now it only shows Bookmarks under ""Recent Bookmarks"" and they drop off the menu after I think 10 bookmarks.    
</p><p>I can still find them when I show ""all bookmarks"" under the ""show all bookmarks"" option in the Bookmark drop down menu, but otherwise if I don't immediately drag them from ""Recent bookmarks"" to an existing Bookmark folder, then they drop off the menu entirely and can only be found when showing all bookmarks.
</p><p>Is this a holdover from when you guys eliminated showing the file drop down menus by default?
</p><p>Why isn't this working properly.  When I bookmark a page it used to bring up a dialogue box asking me where I'd like to bookmark it.   Bring this back.

- Dock or monitor has no impact on Firefox behaviour with other laptops.
