The same thing on chrome works incredibly fast (as it did on Firefox until a while ago). I did not exactly notice when it started becoming so slow. Chrome has the same number of logins stored (for anyone wandering), so it is not about the number but it is how it is handled by each browser.

</p><p>I can still find them when I show ""all bookmarks"" under the ""show all bookmarks"" option in the Bookmark drop down menu, but otherwise if I don't immediately drag them from ""Recent bookmarks"" to an existing Bookmark folder, then they drop off the menu entirely and can only be found when showing all bookmarks.

I am trying to import all data from chrome.","<p>I am new to firefox so I am wanting to import all data from Chrome. I already worked around this issue for bookmarks by downloading to html but there is no option for passwords. Chrome, or any form of google, is not showing up as an option. I personally dont want to go to every site I have ever been to just to reenter passwords. Some of which I relied on the password fill on google. I'd really appreciate a solution to this problem.

However, the issue wasn't repeatable on my site. After some digging, I found that its possible for a corrupt `cookies.sqlite` if the max file size has been reached and a suggestion that FF automatically resets this `cookies.sqlite` store when this happens. 
</p><p>I suspect that this issue happened when the user maxed out their cookies, causing a corrupt `cookies.sqlite` file. Then, when they restarted FF, their store had been cleared and they had no problems.
</p><p>However, I cannot find any documentation about FF behavior when in handling corrupt cookies or resetting the `cookies.sqlite` file. I'm looking for some concrete answers. What is FF's cookie store limit, and what is its behavior (if any) when the store is maxed?
</p><p>Worth mentioning, this was FF on Linux. I don't know the specs beyond that.
