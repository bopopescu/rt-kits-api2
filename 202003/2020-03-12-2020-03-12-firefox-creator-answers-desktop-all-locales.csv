</p><p>""The page isnâ€™t redirecting properly"" ""An error occurred during a connection to <a href=""http://doc-0k-38-docs.googleusercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">doc-0k-38-docs.googleusercontent.com</a>"".
</p><p>This only happens in Firefox.  IE and Chrome download files just fine.
</p><p>I have done the following with no change in this symptom:
-  Cleared Data (cookies and cache)
-  Set Enhanced Tracking Protection to OFF
-  Changed Browser Privacy to Custom with all options unchecked
-  Unchecked ""Block pop-up windows""
-  Added Permission Exclusions for Pop-ups and Cookies
-  Run Firefox in Safe Mode
</p><p>None of the steps above either together or alone changed the error message.
</p><p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

However, whenever I move the mouse it snaps out of it and the video plays ok. But a few seconds after I stop moving the mouse, back to the choppyness.
I've noticed that anything in 60fps tends to be ok.
This is a brand new computer, fresh install of windows, latest updates/drivers installed.
Everything seems fine on Microsoft Edge.

1281801,2020-03-11 17:31:42 -0800,2020-03-11T20:06:29Z,Firefox slow on a brand new machine,"<p>I use Firefox on all of my devices. On a new Windows Surface Laptop 3 (Ryzen 5 3580U, 8GB RAM) the speed is unbearable. Competitor product is fine as a workaround. Firefox in safe mode works great. Behaviour is observed on a brand new install (no extensions, etc.). Firefox is updated to latest version (74.0). Any help would be appreciated. 
</p><p>Thanks
</p><p>Edit 1:
- Confirmed that no performance decrease when not using an external dock (Dell Universal Dock).
- Performance decrease most notable when displaying Firefox on 4K monitor connected to DP in dock. Performance better when displaying on 1080P monitor connected through HDMI (but still not as smooth as no Dock).
- Dock or monitor has no impact on Firefox behaviour with other laptops.

How can that filter be removed so all visits are visible? My goal is a list of URLs visited sorted chronologically.

I am trying to import all data from chrome.","<p>I am new to firefox so I am wanting to import all data from Chrome. I already worked around this issue for bookmarks by downloading to html but there is no option for passwords. Chrome, or any form of google, is not showing up as an option. I personally dont want to go to every site I have ever been to just to reenter passwords. Some of which I relied on the password fill on google. I'd really appreciate a solution to this problem.

However, the issue wasn't repeatable on my site. After some digging, I found that its possible for a corrupt `cookies.sqlite` if the max file size has been reached and a suggestion that FF automatically resets this `cookies.sqlite` store when this happens. 
</p><p>I suspect that this issue happened when the user maxed out their cookies, causing a corrupt `cookies.sqlite` file. Then, when they restarted FF, their store had been cleared and they had no problems.
</p><p>However, I cannot find any documentation about FF behavior when in handling corrupt cookies or resetting the `cookies.sqlite` file. I'm looking for some concrete answers. What is FF's cookie store limit, and what is its behavior (if any) when the store is maxed?
</p><p>Worth mentioning, this was FF on Linux. I don't know the specs beyond that.
