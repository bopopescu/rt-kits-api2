Recently, I bought a new pc with Win10 and rely on FF for my personal browsing too. Unfortunately, I found that the same feature I found on macOS is not working on PC (but it is available on Edge).  I tried some suggestions found online involving modifying a couple of values on config page (browser.gesture.swipe.left/right), but sorted no effect (tbh the values were probably already set properly).  </p><p>In the end, is there any chance to activate this feature on FF on Win10, preferably without addons? Or is it a problem related to OS/hardware? </p><p>Thank you and have a nice day ^^ </p>",firefox-740;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",enrico.pontello
