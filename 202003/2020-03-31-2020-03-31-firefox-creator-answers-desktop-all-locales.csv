I can edit pre-existing bookmarks at first, and I can make new bookmarks by pressing the ""Bookmark this page"" star, but cannot change where that bookmark is placed, and after doing that just once that I can no longer edit any bookmarks. Sync still works and bookmarks can be changed in Firefox mobile and synced with the bugged desktop session. ""Verify integrity"" shows no problems while this is active, and the browser console does not show any errors while trying to edit bookmarks. No other aspects of the browser seem to be affected. Restarting Firefox fixes the issue. This has only been occurring over the last month and has never occurred that I can remember before this February. Deleting my profile, redoing my bookmarks, and even totally deleting all AppData Folders and my account and starting totally from scratch has not fixed the issue. There are no unusual characters in my user folder's name. Other people who have experienced this bug have had errors show up in verify integrity, so if anyone knows anything else that might cause this I'd appreciate the help. </p>",bookmarks;desktop;firefox-740;windows-10;escalate;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1301526;1301529;,ringtail.email
