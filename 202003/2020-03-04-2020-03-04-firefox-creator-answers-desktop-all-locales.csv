</p><p>I'm running Xubuntu 18.04.4 LTS &amp; recently switched from waterfox to Firefox 73.0.1. I have been bugged by two problems that I haven't been able to fix myself &amp; was hoping that someone here could possibly help.
</p><p>[ Problem_1. Sync has stopped working.... ]
Whenever I open the synced tabs sidebar all I see is ""Connect Another Device"". On android I'm running Firefox Nightly version 75.0a1 &amp; I've signed out &amp; then re-signed in, but still nothing. The sidebar stays the same as the screenshot above. Both devices show under devices &amp; apps &amp; I can send tabs between both browsers. I just cannot use the synced tabs sidebar. I use sync daily &amp; hope to find a fix soon. Here is the most recent sync log from about:sync-log.

</p><p>[ Problem_2. Cannot fully use Instagram.... ]
I can access <a href=""http://instagram.com"" rel=""nofollow"">instagram.com</a> &amp; browse through the site without any problems. However if I try to like, comment, share or follow I constantly get ""Action Blocked"" popping up &amp; whatever I've just tried to do has been unsucessful. I can confirm that instagram works perfectly on both chromium &amp; brave desktop browsers &amp; also the official android app.
</p><p>I have attached two screenshots relating to both my problems &amp; can confirm that uninstalling &amp; reinstalling firefox did nothing. Many thanks in advanced for replying &amp; helping me :)

After problems with Firefox (possibly related to Kaspersky Internet Security software), I finally resorted to: a) uninstalling and deleting all Kaspersky software (which had no effect), b) deleting all Firefox and Mozilla files, and c) reinstalling a new downloaded version of Firefox. Firefox still will still not launch when the Firefox icon in the Applications folder is clicked. The so-called safe-mode launch is not available when the Option key was used for launch. I can launch the new version of Firefox using a Terminal command (which also restores previous in-use windows and website pages that were in use), but no web pages will load anyway.

1281231,2020-03-03 18:05:05 -0800,2020-03-03T18:40:39Z,15 connection established at start up,"<p>When I start Firefox it makes upto 15 https:// connections to <a href=""http://cloudfront.net"" rel=""nofollow"">cloudfront.net</a>  and something else.
I altered the about:config and did this as shown in another post, but to no avail
browser.selfsupport.url. 
double-click it and change its value to a blank string
Here is a sreen grab of the connections I get on start-up, sometimes it takes about 5 mins before I can use the internet.
(I have almsot the slowest connection in the UK, at 0.03 MB/sec, 34kbps), so this would only slow down a fast connection for a matter of seconds.
I live high in the mountains with no wi-fi and only an old copper phone line to carry my signal.

Nothing else to do through network setting  except the above, so the problem is in your part not us the users. 
I have read the dialogue said Firefox is not trusted the page    I think if the page is for forbidden things the page will open at once   Most of the pages I visited many times using Firefox browser now cannot be opened 
I see the matter is not beyond eset 
Here cannot open
