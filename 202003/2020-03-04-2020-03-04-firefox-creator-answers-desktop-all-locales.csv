</p><p>I am in Private Browsing mode and prefer to stay that way. The default 'Standard Enhanced Tracking Protection' option is on.
</p><p>I have access to all websites except one, the Value Village club member page.
</p><p>A pop-up appears on the bottom of the webpage to the effect of 'we use cookies to improve user experience' with 'cookie preferences' and 'accept cookie' options.
</p><p>I click on 'accept cookies' and attempt to sign in but there is an error stating 'There could be a misconfiguration in the system or a service outage. We track these errors automatically,'
</p><p>I clicked on the shield icon to the left of the URL address, turned off 'enhanced tracking protection for this site,' and attempted to sign in again but still no success so I turned enhanced tracking protection back on for this site.
</p><p>I went into the Privacy settings and clicked 'Manage Exceptions' and there are options to 'cancel' or 'save changes' but no options to add a website.
</p><p>I went into the Privacy settings and clicked on 'Manage Permissions' for cookie and site data, added the website, and clicked allow but still no success.
</p><p>I clicked on the website pop-up 'cookie preferences' option  and there are six types of cookies, two of which are essential for website functionality so I select 'active' for both types of cookies. I attempt to sign in again but the same error message is displayed.
</p><p>I selected 'allow' for all six types of cookies and attempted to sign in but still no success.
</p><p>Is there an easy fix that I am overlooking?

I altered the about:config and did this as shown in another post, but to no avail
browser.selfsupport.url. 
double-click it and change its value to a blank string
Here is a sreen grab of the connections I get on start-up, sometimes it takes about 5 mins before I can use the internet.
(I have almsot the slowest connection in the UK, at 0.03 MB/sec, 34kbps), so this would only slow down a fast connection for a matter of seconds.
I live high in the mountains with no wi-fi and only an old copper phone line to carry my signal.

Nothing else to do through network setting  except the above, so the problem is in your part not us the users. 
I have read the dialogue said Firefox is not trusted the page    I think if the page is for forbidden things the page will open at once   Most of the pages I visited many times using Firefox browser now cannot be opened 
I see the matter is not beyond eset 
Here cannot open
