I can visit <a href=""http://website.com"" rel=""nofollow"">website.com</a> twenty times over the course of several weeks and autocomplete still doesn't work. Some urls are always autocompleted correctly. ""<a href=""http://news.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">news.google.com</a>"" autocompletes successfully every time. ""<a href=""http://linkedin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">linkedin.com</a>"" never autocompletes. The urls are present in History. I can open History and see ""<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.linkedin.com</a>"" sitting right there, but autocomplete doesn't suggest it. </p><p>- I have to re-login to random websites every time. For example, I have to do complete log ins for Amazon and LinkedIn every time I visit. I always check ""Remember me on this computer"", and then I do TFA, and then when I visit Amazon and LinkedIn tomorrow I have to log in and do TFA again. Firefox doesn't even suggest my username. I never have to log back in to any Google websites. The cookies are there. I can see Amazon and LinkedIn cookies on my local machine, but Firefox makes me log back in and doesn't remember my username from the last thirty logins. </p><p>I'm running up-to-date Firefox with default settings on computers at home and at work running MacOS 10.15, Windows10, and Ubuntu 18.04.
