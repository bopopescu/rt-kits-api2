There is this at least three years old GUI bug that is not yet fixed, I'm writing this post to show the temporary workaround and hopefully get more interest in the bug itself.
This would be an urgent usability bug, but it's still here because probably not everyone can reproduce it.
</p><p>Link to one of the bug reports:
<a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1504021"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1504021</a>
</p><p><br>
&gt; Description
</p><p>Removing the title bar doesn't set an offset for the right-click menu → the right-click menu will appear slightly wrong positioned, with its first entry below the mouse cursor → the first entry of the menu will get a mouse-release event and will trigger.
</p><p>The effect of this can be different depending on what you right-click:
</p>
<ul><li> right-click some empty area in a web-page: you will be taken back to the previous page (because the first menu entry does that)
</li><li> right-click a link: you will open the link in a new tab (because the first menu entry does that)
</li></ul>
<p><br>
&gt; Steps
</p>
<ul><li> Have a non-maximized Firefox window.
</li><li> Disable the title bar (through the ""Customize..."" option)
</li><li> Right-click anywhere on a webpage: you will be taken to the previous page.
</li></ul>
<p><br>
&gt; Workaround
</p><p>Enable user styles by setting toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true.
Create ""chrome"" folder in your profile directory. Inside, create ""userChrome.css"", and write:
</p><pre>   #contentAreaContextMenu{ margin: 20px 0 0 20px }

No errors, warnings, etc.  It is as if you never entered the url.  Tried about 50 sites, found 4 that don't work (ones I use regularly).  Found a thread about 70.1 that sounded similar which suggested setting dom.storage.next_gen to false.  Checked and it was already false.  Tried safe mode - no difference.

Let me make this very clear. This is way beyond my comprehension.  I asked someone for help but they were lost, too.  What is wrong with a simplified way of doing things? Just a move tabs like before...it seems there are a lot of people who want that.  I'm thinking I either have to quit using FF or back up to a different version.

On all platforms I've tried.","<p>TextNow, Google Voice, anything RTC.... Calls drop CONSTANTLY, and sometimes are flat out rejected before I even get a ring. It is obviously caused by firefox itself, too, not each and every individual platform can possibly be responsible for this issue. That would be absurd. Absurd, such as myself having to open up windows task manager and end Firefox manually so the calls stop getting rejected before they even ring. Another thing, why does this browser hog up SO MUCH MEMORY?!? It's ridiculous that this thing sometimes eats up as much RAM as a VM, on all of my machines. It's like I'm watching this platform become glitchier and glitchier over the years, and I just wish it actually worked like it used to.
And before you even ask... I keep firefox up to date, I have uBlock and Strict Pop-Up Blocker installed, so please, nobody try to pass off blame to either of these add-ons. Because, frankly, these should be mandatory and included features on a web browser that does nothing but brag about how safe and secure it is for your privacy.
I shouldn't have to be a software engineer to understand how to make this thing work.

I recently got a new operating system and ever since then images in firefox are not shown until they are completely loaded, unlike before where they were partially shown from top to bottom during loading. I am using the firefox profile from the old OS but I've tried the troubleshooting steps on this link: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-problems-images-not-show"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-problems-images-not-show</a> including trying a default profile. 
</p><p>The old OS was Windows 7, and the new and current OS I use is Windows 10. I'm currently on Firefox 73.0.1, 64-bit
</p><p>I've had difficulty finding people with a similiar issue. When googling I'd mostly get articles and forums posts about web developers who wish to make the images on their site either not show until fully loaded, or only load when the users actually sees that part of the site. But that is not what I'm having trouble with. I want the images on the sites I visit to begin to show BEFORE they're fully loaded, dropping down like a curtain.
</p><p>This may seem like a minor issue but it can become very annoying when you're browsing wallpapers or such, since I'm simply staring at a blank screen for a moment before the entire image pops up.
</p><p>I hope someone can help me. Thanks.
