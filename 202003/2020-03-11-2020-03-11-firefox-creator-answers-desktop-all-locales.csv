</p><p>However, I'm noticing playback of video, especially Youtube, is incredibly choppy, with lost frames and cuts. It's unwatchable. There is no such problem using Chrome or Edge. 
</p><p>What could be the cause of this? I notice there's some scaling weirdness in some menus in Firefox, as by default the surface scales apps to 150%, could this be a cause?

</p><p>I would like to save some settings that would take a lot of time to be done manually again, after an update. 
I have added about twenty search engines with the help of different Firefox addons. During my last update, these were lost (the search bar only had the default searche engines) although Firefox was synchronized (and conserved my bookmarks and other settings).
</p><p>Would anybody have an idea how to save or synchronize them?

Lo he venido haciendo durante años y de repente, en un momento determinado, se queda bloqueada la página y de ahí no pasa.
He intentado instalar una versión anterior, por si el error fuera consecuencia de algún cambio en la última versión, pero tampoco he tenido éxito.
Tampoco me funciona con el navegador Chrome, aunque los de ING me han dicho que se debía a un error de la última versión del navegador.
Sí me funciona con Explorer, pero habitualmente no lo uso.
Muchas gracias por adelantado.
Un saludo.
Carlos

On all platforms I've tried.","<p>TextNow, Google Voice, anything RTC.... Calls drop CONSTANTLY, and sometimes are flat out rejected before I even get a ring. It is obviously caused by firefox itself, too, not each and every individual platform can possibly be responsible for this issue. That would be absurd. Absurd, such as myself having to open up windows task manager and end Firefox manually so the calls stop getting rejected before they even ring. Another thing, why does this browser hog up SO MUCH MEMORY?!? It's ridiculous that this thing sometimes eats up as much RAM as a VM, on all of my machines. It's like I'm watching this platform become glitchier and glitchier over the years, and I just wish it actually worked like it used to.
And before you even ask... I keep firefox up to date, I have uBlock and Strict Pop-Up Blocker installed, so please, nobody try to pass off blame to either of these add-ons. Because, frankly, these should be mandatory and included features on a web browser that does nothing but brag about how safe and secure it is for your privacy.
I shouldn't have to be a software engineer to understand how to make this thing work.

I recently got a new operating system and ever since then images in firefox are not shown until they are completely loaded, unlike before where they were partially shown from top to bottom during loading. I am using the firefox profile from the old OS but I've tried the troubleshooting steps on this link: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-problems-images-not-show"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-problems-images-not-show</a> including trying a default profile. 
</p><p>The old OS was Windows 7, and the new and current OS I use is Windows 10. I'm currently on Firefox 73.0.1, 64-bit
</p><p>I've had difficulty finding people with a similiar issue. When googling I'd mostly get articles and forums posts about web developers who wish to make the images on their site either not show until fully loaded, or only load when the users actually sees that part of the site. But that is not what I'm having trouble with. I want the images on the sites I visit to begin to show BEFORE they're fully loaded, dropping down like a curtain.
</p><p>This may seem like a minor issue but it can become very annoying when you're browsing wallpapers or such, since I'm simply staring at a blank screen for a moment before the entire image pops up.
</p><p>I hope someone can help me. Thanks.
