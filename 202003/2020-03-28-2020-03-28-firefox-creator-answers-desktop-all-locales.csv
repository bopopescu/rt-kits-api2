First it stops displaying some web pages and hangs.  Second it starts reducing the size of print files sent to the printer.  I know this is a  mozilla problem because I have other browsers that do not have this problem. Third if I want to print an article from the internet is starts limiting me to one page of a 3 -+ article.  It never used to do this - So do I have to reinstall it once a week or is there a fix for the demented behavior that locks settings down and does not allow it to be changed. </p>,firefox-740;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1301041;,jimcochr

I would create them myself but I don't know what they should be set to (the article only says to click the ""reset"" button next to them).

To be more specific, the MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia() method does not have audio capture support. And Firefox doesn't support private fields (Chrome does).

I configured Firefox language to Brazilian Portuguese, but it doesn't work tool.  </p><p>The operating system is all right, because, as mentioned above, the other softwares are seeing the correct layout of the keyboard (Brazilian Portuguese ABNT 2). If anyone has any hint of what might be done to the Firefox pass to see the keyboard layout set in the operating system and can post here, will be of great help.
