Problem: Firefox is not auto updating for a long time and each time I have to manually do it.  After looking into it, I notice the maintenance service is not starting.
With UAC disabled or not it has no effect.
Remove all AV from PC no effect.

They were saved in a windows.old file on my Passport.  I used the Import and Backup button, selected Restore, and choose my file. It's a json file.  It then gave me an error message ""unsupported file type.""  
</p><p>BTW, the file ends in .jsonlz45dd510a6.  It's not recognized as a json file, so I had choose 'all files"" and then highlighted it to select it, and received the above error message.  I then tried making a copy but omitting the letters and numbers after .jason, and tried using that, but got an error message ""unable to process the backup file.""
