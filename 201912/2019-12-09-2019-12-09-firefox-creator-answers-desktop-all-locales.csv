</p><p>I am running a macOS Catalina v 10.15.1 on a 3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5; 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4.
</p><p>I am NOT having a performance issue.  Instead, the browser is not responding as expected when given tasks.
</p><p>1.  It will not open a link in a new tab.  The tab does not open and it's as if I never clicked on the menu item.  Same with open in new window.
2.  It will not open the default search engine from the URL bar.  Instead, it responds as if I mistyped a URL.
3.  It will not allow me to set a Default Search Engine.  The option to do that in Preferences is a drop-down arrow that does nothing when clicked.
4.  It will not allow me to Remove an add-on.  Usually issues with Firefox are related to add-ons, but when I Remove an add-on, then restart Firefox, the add-on is still there.
5. (silly, minor issue) I'd like the tab bar to be dark, again.  The white tabs are too bright!  I know this is silly, but you asked...
</p><p>I did run Firefox in safe mode and all of the same problems continue to occur.

Yes, I clicked on the little ""eye"" next to the password field under Tools.Options.Privacy .. and yes, I tried trusting and just using the stored password both for the UID (it kept the old password) and also for the ""no username"" and neither works.  I can update the password manually when under Tools.Options.Privacy, but I do not have the time nor inclination to do this for hundreds of logins.

I use it every day plenty of times on the phone and laptop. Today I can't open it. Firefox says theres an update, so I download it. I then have to verify my firefox account with my email...of which I cannot open. Yet again another stupid update poorly researched and executed. No doubt I will be told its my fault because I dont have update 72.3.56.786  or install 234.3987.2 or some crap no one would ever know about

</p><p>All of a sudden i get a long list of login credentials suggestions. Normally FF would only just present login cred suggestions for the site name i'm trying to log on, but now i get a long list of them. Also for sites that i'm not on. Is this one of the 'virtues' of LockWise?
</p><p>What happend along the way, and can i turn this 'feature' off so that i only get login credential suggestions for the site i'm actually trying to log on?

I checked to see if this problem occurs in Chrome and it does NOT, so this is only happening in Firefox. I hope you can help me figure this out.  ~Thank You, P.S. Here is how the page looks. It is not supposed to be loading like this.

Eu consegui transmitir há uma semana mas nesta sexta o problema não me deixou e ainda continua hoje (domingo).
</p><p>Eu já tentei:
- Reiniciar o Firefox em modo seguro
- Restaurar o Firefox
- Atualizar o Flash
- Limpar dados de navegação
- Outras contas do Youtube
- Atualizar windows
- Usar Firefox em outro computador
