Now if FF crashes for some reason or there is a power outage, sometimes session restore only works for one profile that is restarted first, while the others lose all the tabs that were open last time. Now I have a feeling that this is much more likely to happen if the browser was recently updated (it happened several times on the first restart after the update).
I reckon that this might have something to do with the session restore only restoring one of the opened windows (which, as I understand, is now fixed).
In each of the profiles the automatic session restore is set on.

Obviously it didn't help and I'm sure at this point I just need to reinstall because it's basically been slowing my computer to a halt every time I've tried to use it since then, but weirdly enough, it completely messed up my extensions too*, even though nothing else regarding settings nor my profile was affected. 
</p><p>I'm fine manually reinstalling the extensions, especially considering I can carry over bookmarks and history anyway, but I must have had thousands of elements blocked on uBlock, all of which are gone, and there's a lot of styles that I don't know if I'd be able to find again as well. If there's some way to retrieve the data related to these extensions if it still exists somewhere, like the aforementioned blocked elements and styles, or scripts on Tampermonkey, or even settings related to the extensions- maybe they're all stored in similar places- then I'd really like to be able to do that. It would be fine just to be able to copy and paste the items back manually again. Even if I can't actually put it back in, it would be nice to be able to retrieve the files where they are so at least it's not wiped out on a reinstall. I realize that it's possible that one of these extensions is causing an issue, but they certainly weren't before this happened (I doubt what I did was actually an issue exacerbated by the extensions and as long as I don't do the same thing again I'd think it would be fine) and either way, even if I don't even use the extensions again, I'd just like to have the data there.
</p>
<ul><li>The extensions themselves aren't uninstalled. Some work normally, some don't, but notably, every time I start Firefox, anything that's stored related to the extension, whether it be settings or just certain specifications, is gone. The toolbar drop-down menus open consistently. For instance, uBlock not only won't actually bring up its element blocker, but it also says it has zero elements blocked since install. Stylus also doesn't work, and all my styles have vanished. Tampermonkey worked running a script on Youtube, but once again, on startup, the script was gone.

Even though LastPass is a ""recommended"" extension, when I try to re-install from Mozilla I get the message ""an unexpected error occurred during installation"" (see attached file). LP users report the same problem on their site but it's clearly a Firefox 71 problem (LP works fine will all my other browsers).

It usually happens at least once per day, and has been happening for weeks. FF, Windows and my mouse driver are up to date. I have tested memory many times (using Memtest86) and my hard drive. I have no crashes except in Firefox during mouse activity. 
</p><p>The BSOD reports vary. Recent ones: Bad Pool Caller (019 and 0C2), PFN List Corrupt (04E), Memory Management Error (01A), ??? (07E), System Service Exception (033). The only consistent thing is using the mouse within Firefox.

The Firefox install is set to ""factory"" defaults with no addons. Most (all?) web sites have one or more elements that either fail to load completely or flash on and off as I move the mouse or scroll through the page. On the affected computer this page fails to load almost entirely, I've written this question on a different machine, also running FF71 though this one is flawless.
</p><p>Some pages, like Googles home page, will eventually stabilize and become usable (their logo is an element that is almost always an issue) but other sites like Bloomberg never seem to stabilize and any attempt to scroll or navigate is like watching a bad light show.
