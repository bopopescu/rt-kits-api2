I wanted to search for strings that show ""100 packets"" but the number needed to be 100 or more.  In the attached screenshot is an entry for 418 packets for example.  I tried using syntax for regular expressions with \d1[0-9][0-9]* but nothing was found, I could not tell if regular expression searches worked in the Find in page box.  Does anyone know if this works and if so, what is the syntax?

Everything apparently works well and preferrable over Chrome especially for the security aspect of it, but I have run into a snag with the printer default. I use a Epson WF-4740 for all my printing via the network. 
I have searched the Help menus and the Internet. I have gone in to the ""about:Config"" and added my printer, saved it and gone out and back into Firefox. Firefox only brings up the default within the program. There are no other choices. After a couple of tries, I see that it won't keep it in default nor allow me to use it even once. I have to use the ... bars for the Print command as an attempt as the regular Printer icon in the tool bar is only for the Firefox default. 
How do I change this to use my Printer preferences and save it as a Default permanently?

Except for Firefox. No matter which page, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Twitter... no sound for videos. Firefox is quiet. If I check my sound settings, the bar for sound input is not even moving, seems like Firefox is just not recognising or forwarding any sound to my USB G560 speakers.
</p><p>On the other hand, everything works in Google Chrome and sound is brilliant. The problem just seems to be with Firefox. I disabled all audio devices, especially my old audio-out where I had my old speakers. I updated the drivers for Realtek HD Audio (even though I am sure I do not need them for the G560) and also updated again driver for the G560 as well as the Logitech G Hub. Firefox is also the latest version.
</p><p>But nothing. Only thing happening is after trying to often to load a video in Firefox to get sound, and checking my sound settings, I get an error message saying the audio enhancements are not working properly and asking me if I wanna disable them. If I click yes, it solves the issue and Firefox is forwarding sound to my G560.
</p><p>Now I thought I can disable any sound enhancements in general in WIndows 8.1... but no chance. I cannot find any setting for that. No matter where I search, it seems only Windows 10 gives that option. There is also no sound enhancement in G Hub or when checkin the system control for devices. Re-Installing the G560 drivers does not change anything.
</p><p>So if I wanna have any sound in Firefox I am depending on the error message popping up... which happens only rarely. But that can't be the solution :( It seems to me the problem is with Firefox, in the way it handles the sound channel or content or whatever... and does not recognize my G560 via USB as speaker system. Even though it is the only one set active in my system.
</p><p>I am really looking for any help and input to solve this please... !

- Launching in safe mode by adding the ""-safe-mode"" comment

- Checking it's not being blocked by antivirus
- Loading the Firefox profile manager by typing ""firefox.exe -P"" in the run dialog box. This does the same as trying to load Firefox - nothing happens

</p><p>Firefox occasionally checks to see if any updates are available for itself and for your search engines. To disable these checks:
</p><pre>   Click the menu button Fx57Menu and select Preferences.
   In the General panel, scroll down to the Firefox Updates section.
   Check Never check for updates (not recommended) and uncheck Automatically update search engines.
   Close the about:preferences page. Any changes you've made will automatically be saved.

I just hate Chrome for the difficult to use UI and bookmark compared to Firefox and most importantly, no separate searchbox.
