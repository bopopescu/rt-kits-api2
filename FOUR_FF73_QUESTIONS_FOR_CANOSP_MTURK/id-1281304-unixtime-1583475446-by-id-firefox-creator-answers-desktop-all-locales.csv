I tried removing old unused bookmarks, creating and (re)arranging into folders and replacing the bookmarks I use often in their old familiar places. It took a couple hours to do that. It appeared to have worked as they were staying put. I closed the browser to do some other tasks and when I reopened the browser again everything was back to its chaotic state as if I hadn't touched it. This started on its own a few days ago and I need it to stop immediately as its driving me nuts not being able to quickly find the ones i need and use regularly. Please help!

I have reinstalled, refreshed settings and restarted my computer (and also ensured that the browser autofill (about:config urlb) is set to ""true"").
</p><p>I am not sure what I may have done, or if it is associated with the upgrade... Any assistance would be greatly appreciated,

I had been using 67, which had become problematic with screen freezes requiring Force Quit. The 72.0.2 appeared to install, showing the new icon in the Dock. I opened it and updated Shockwave Flash to the latest, which asked for a restart of the browser. Once restarted, I tried to open Firefox a pop-up claimed the profile was missing or inaccessible, but I could find it easily in its normal place.

</p><p>I've recently installed version 73.01 of FF and have been trying to import all my Chrome data into it. The online instructions are using an old UI, and I cannot find ""Import"" under any bookmarks pop out menu or toolbar. I have tried searching setting for ""Import"" to no avail. Has import been removed with this version or am I looking in the wrong spot?
</p><p>Thanks
