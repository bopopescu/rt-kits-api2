Bookmarks are changing on tool bar constantly. How do I stop it?,"Bookmarks on toolbar are rearranging themselves every few seconds. I tried removing old unused bookmarks, creating and (re)arranging into folders and replacing the bookmarks I use often in their old familiar places. It took a couple hours to do that. It appeared to have worked as they were staying put. I closed the browser to do some other tasks and when I reopened the browser again everything was back to its chaotic state as if I hadn't touched it. This started on its own a few days ago and I need it to stop immediately as its driving me nuts not being able to quickly find the ones i need and use regularly. Please help! "
How do I get URL autocomplete (in the address bar) to work again?,"I am not sure what I did (other than upgrade to the latest version of Firefox), but the autocomplete URLs doesn't work any more for new websites (autocomplete works for some older websites). I have reinstalled, refreshed settings and restarted my computer (and also ensured that the browser autofill (about:config urlb) is set to ""true""). I am not sure what I may have done, or if it is associated with the upgrade... Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, "
"update to 72.0.2 would not open, said profile was missing or inaccessible, but it WAS NOT","I just downloaded and installed Firefox 72.0.2 for my Mac. I had been using 67, which had become problematic with screen freezes requiring Force Quit. The 72.0.2 appeared to install, showing the new icon in the Dock. I opened it and updated Shockwave Flash to the latest, which asked for a restart of the browser. Once restarted, I tried to open Firefox a pop-up claimed the profile was missing or inaccessible, but I could find it easily in its normal place. "
Importing from Chrome in Version 73.01,"Hi I've recently installed version 73.01 of FF and have been trying to import all my Chrome data into it. The online instructions are using an old UI, and I cannot find ""Import"" under any bookmarks pop out menu or toolbar. I have tried searching setting for ""Import"" to no avail. Has import been removed with this version or am I looking in the wrong spot? Thanks "
