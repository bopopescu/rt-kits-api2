1276921,2020-01-09 13:55:58 -0800,2020-01-09T13:55:58Z,PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR when browsing to our internal Thycotic Secret Server with own MS PKI issued certs,"<p>We have our own internal Microsoft certificate root authority and we have certs issued from it automatically to all of our Windows endpoints and servers. Our internal Thycotic Secret Server is one of these endpoints, and SS runs over IIS. I have many, many servers in our environment that are bound to these certificates, and they work just fine in Firefox. The cert for the Secret Server is just like all of the other certs in our enterprise. The certificate is fully valid and trusted in IE, Edge, Chrome and in Firefox. We have GPO's in place to ensure the CA Root Authority of our PKI and issuing server is trusted and the certs are compliant, fully standard and functional in all web browsers. 
</p><p>But this one server absolutely WILL NOT bring up a web page when we browse to Secret Server in Firefox. It stops cold with a PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR, and there is no option to bypass it whatsoever. We don't have these issues with other servers using the same type of certs. We don't have this issue with any other browsers - only Firefox. I've even generated a wildcard cert that works everywhere on our internal domain, in all browsers, but if I bind it in IIS on the Secret Server, it just won't work.
</p><p>I've worked with Thycotic support, and they have no solutions, only to point their fingers at the browser, because the error is in the browser, and not from the web server (even though they can't see any errors from the web server, because no page ever gets displayed.
</p><p>I'm stumped on this, and because it works everywhere except for this browser on this server (and this happens on ANY workstation in our environment - existing or brand new Firefox install), I can't understand what is causing this. Is there anything I can look at in some logs, config file or somewhere else? 
</p><p>I did see an option in the SS config to disable HSTS, and I tried to disable that, but it didn't make any difference. I'm still fully inclined to point the finger at Thycotic and their software, but since they can't replicate the issue on their end, they refuse to accept any ownership in resolving this.
</p><p>If anyone has anything to offer, I would greatly appreciate it. I would really like Firefox to be my one and only daily driver web browser, but because the server that serves up the passwords for the accounts, endpoints and websites in our environment doesn't work, it kinda makes it difficult to use, or recommend to others.

I toggle between two pages.  The ""View Page"" and the ""Edit Page"".  But whenever I am on the ""View Page"" inside of the Pinned Tab and click on a page link that would change it to the ""Edit Page"", it opens the ""Edit Page"" in a new tab instead of the current one.
</p><p>I am aware that there is a browser.link.open_newwindow (default is 3, where 1 is the current tab, 2 is new window, and 3 is new tab) and a browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction (default is 2, where 0 is all, 1 is none, and 2 is only special windows) setting on the about:config page.
</p><p>It was suggested to change browser.link.open_newwindow to 1 (current tab) and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0 (all).
</p><p>When I do this, it does make the ""Edit Page"" link open up in the same Pinned Tab as the ""View Page"" that I am already on.  But it also causes all of the links in all the other tabs (not Pinned) to also open up in the same tab instead of a new one.  I know that holding down keys like CTRL might help with that, but I also have programs that open up pages when clicked on (you can't hold down CTRL when clicking on the system tray icon).  For example, Howard E-Mail Notifier will open up my Yahoo Mail in the same tab with these settings instead of a new tab.
</p><p>I REALLY don't want to hold down CTRL for links or go through any other hassle or BS.  I just want to see if there is a settings or a way to make it so that links in normal tabs (not Pinned) open up in new tabs, and links in Pinned Tabs open up in the same Pinned tab.  If it isn't possible, fine.  But I thought that I would ask.  Thanks.

The problem is, the setting in question just keeps resetting to ""true"" on its own after each and every browser update, so I had to manually change it back to ""false"" after FF69 update, FF70 update, FF71 update and FF72 update, basically 4 additional times already if not even more (I don't quite remember about XX.0.1 types of updates).
It's frankly getting ridiculous and extremely annoying by that point. Is there a way to stop FF from screwing my ""about:config"" settings without my consent?

If you want to open links in Gmail (with a normal, left click) in a new window, you type about:config in the search bar, accept, then search browser.link.open_newwindow and set the value to 2. This will open clicked Gmail links in new window.

Aunque tengo mi firefox sincronizado con mi cuenta, cada vez que inicio el explorador o habro una pestaña nueva, es como si recien hubiera instalado firefox. Ejemplo: abro facebook, me sale la pagina de bienvenida donde me pide mi nombre de usuario y contraseña, firefox me las muestra, las selecciono, inicio sesion en facebook yse me pide que selecciona una opcion para que no se me pida de nuevo las contraseñas. Cierro firefox y lo abro de nuevo y no esta el historial, si voy a facebook, tengo que repetir todo el proceso. Pasa lo mismo con mercadolibre, gmail y otras que necesita inicio de sesion.
No guarda historial ni inicios de sesion, pero si dice que esta sincronizado con mi cuenta de firefox.
Alguien tiene alguna idea de que pasa? 
Alguna solución?
Gracias

FINALLY!  BUT, if I use that same profile synced onto a Windows 7 system at work, the separators no longer appear even after syncing.  Is there some small component that is in Windows 10 but not in 7 that is causing this?  I really would like my separators back.  Getting tired of adding "" |"" to the end of some of the names in the bookmarks toolbar to simulate this.  Yes, I know Windows 7 support ends this month, but my work does not seem concerned in the least. :/
