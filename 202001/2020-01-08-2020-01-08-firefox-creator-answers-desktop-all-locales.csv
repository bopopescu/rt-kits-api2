Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks.
Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could  also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc.
</p><p>For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section.
</p><p>The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites.
Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks.
This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find.
It may also be a government imposed function. Either one.
</p><p>So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ?
</p><p>WTF ?
I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ?
What the hell are you talking about ?
YOu care about my privacy ? STOP websites from reading my bookmarks !!!!!!!!!!!
Websites should have NO access to ANYTHING. They should not know what browser i have, they should not know what bookmarks i have.

</p><p>I have recently switched to using Firefox across my three devices - my Dell XPS13 laptop, my Surface Go tablet and my Samsung S10 phone. I have the same Firefox account set up on all three devices but I cannot get the devices to sync. All three are listed under 'my devices' on all three accounts, but the tablet and phone seem to share one setup and my Dell laptop seems to be entirely separate. I cannot get my laptop to sync with my other two devices at all. Neither can I get Lockwise to sync (which is particularly frustrating).

</p><p>My Firefox browser (72.0, 64-bit, Win8.1) became slower at loading pages with the previous update, and I've noticed that it's caused by the same problem on each page to varying degrees. I'll click on a page to load it, then the black 'finding' dot on the tab will bobble about a bit, then it turns to the blue 'connecting' dot and keeps loading for minutes. At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring. For example, looking up '<a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a>' took 4 minutes 23 seconds from entering it to it loading fully. In that time covered the following:
</p><p>Looking up <a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a>

</p><p>I don't have this problem with anything else connected to the network - I tested the WiFi connection just now on my Xbox and got 35.73, 34.31 and 35.94mb/s, but trying to load <a href=""http://broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">broadbandspeedchecker.co.uk</a> on Firefox took 16m 13s just to load the page, and it's not even got near to starting the test. In that time I tried to write down all the pages it listed as looking up, waiting for, reading or TLS handshake with..., and have 44 different addresses that it was cycling through (probably more as some were very rapid) including:

I've done a full Malwarebytes scan and a full Bullguard scan with no hits, full adwcleaner with nothing, I've reset Firefox, deleted the cache and cookies and have Tracking set to Strict and still no joy.

<p>I'm prepared to believe that this is ISP-related, rather than Firefox, but on the off-chance that it's somehow down to a misconfiguration of the captive-portal detection servers right now, I thought that I'd report it here.
</p><p>I've stopped this from happening by setting about:config  network.captive-portal-service.enabled to false, but would ideally prefer that this not recur on the next profile reset.

When I've done this, I quite often have to refresh a localhost domain several times before Firefox loads it correctly. It will either say it can't connect, or will load the page without any CSS. A further refresh will work, but this process always continues. Works fine in Chrome.
</p><p>I'd appreciate any pointers to fixing this! Thanks

Lately, when I click on an embedded email link, such as an email address displayed on a website, rather than opening Thunderbird directly, internet explorer opens a dialogue box and asks me to confirm to open Thunderbird, which then results in a crash, as IE continues to open the dialogue box several times at once. The result is that both firefox freezes and IE crashes, and the entire operation is not successful.
</p><p>Please note that I did not change any settings manually, and I do not use IE for any operations.
