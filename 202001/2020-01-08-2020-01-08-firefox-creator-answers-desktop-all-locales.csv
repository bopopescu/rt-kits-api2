I have checked, and double checked my server settings and they are correct. I haven't had any issues with Thunderbird until I changed from POP3 to IMAP. Not sure if these errors began after a Thunderbird update, but I regularly check and install the latest updates. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
Forgot to mention that some e-mails don't come in timely; sometimes even up to a day late.

Yo venia usando firefox perfectamente hasta el dia de hoy que cuando lo abri no estaban mis pestañas guardadas, ni sicronizadas. Esto no me molesta tanto, sino que apesar de tener la configuracion para que me restaure las pestañas de la sesion. Sigue cerrandome todo cada vez que abro y cierro el navegador.
Probe reinstalar y esto funciona. Pero cuando sincronizo mi cuenta, vuelve el problema.
</p><p>Me gustaria saber por que me puede estar pasando esto..

After I cancel the task sequence, I go into windows and Firefox is happily waiting me on the desktop!
</p><p>I think it is got to do with the detection method because the detection method is set to look for .msi product code and when i run a powershell command ""Get-WmiObject Win32_Product | sort name | Format-Table IdentifyingNumber, Name, LocalPackage -AutoSize"" on a freshly deployed PC I get all of the .msi codes but Firefoxe's. Can somebody from the dev team check this?

Lately, when I click on an embedded email link, such as an email address displayed on a website, rather than opening Thunderbird directly, internet explorer opens a dialogue box and asks me to confirm to open Thunderbird, which then results in a crash, as IE continues to open the dialogue box several times at once. The result is that both firefox freezes and IE crashes, and the entire operation is not successful.
