Our company uses a proxy in whitelisting mode. 
Until recently, clicking any HTTPS link unauthorized by proxy (403 by Squid) would result in an unambiguous error page informing the user that the connection was refused (if needed, they can open a corporate page showing the most recent hostnames blocked from their machine and request authorization).
</p><p>Now, when clicking an unauthorized link (403 by Squid proxy) in FF, nothing happens. The GUI simply stales as nothing happened. 
To reproduce:
1. Configure FF with an HTTP proxy (squid) in deny by default.
2. Open duckduckgo, search something, and click on any https link that has not been whitelisted in the proxy.
3. After the click, nothing happens -&gt; no error, no information message, nothing.
(in the dev tools -&gt; network tab, one can see a 403 status.)
</p><p>This also happens when browsing websites: if the website includes a link to another website that is not whitelisted, nothing happens, the user is not informed that the host could not be reached.
</p><p>This seems like a mechanism has been broken, as FF always used to inform the user of the host not responding with an error page.
</p><p>Thanks for reading,

I do not have the server running, so that I can see what will happen if a client disconnects to network issues, going offline, etc. For the first ten or so connections, Firefox 72 behaves as expected, but then it starts stalling new websocket creations. Eventually the stall peaks at about 1 minute, but two connections are attempted before each stall.
</p><p>I don't see how this is rational behavior. I don't want a user who disconnects from my server (e.g. leaves WiFi) to have to wait up to a minute to reconnect. Even a refresh or close tab and reopen will not get an immediate websocket connection attempt. The only way to get an immediate attempt is to close Firefox entirely and reopen.
</p><p>I also don't understand the policy of websockets using an increasing timeout (up to a few minutes or more) for several reconnection attempts while in the OPEN state. Thankfully there is an obvious workaround which is to implement manual ping/pong with close on timeout.
</p><p>I suppose I could make some HTTP requests to see if the server is up and then create a websocket but that seems just ugly.
</p><p>On Chromium, the maximum timeout is only a few seconds and through the entire timeout Chromium is still making tcp SYN attempts several times per second.
</p><p>Reproduce:
- client.js: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/NP7iWbEg</a>

</p><p>When OneTouch is activated, the text 'Securely logging you in...' appears overlayed with the spinning wheel in the popup window. This continues indefinitely.
</p><p>When this is not activated the window doesn't progress further after entering the email as prompted by the window and pressing Next.
</p><p>It's possible to login to PayPal in a separate tab however that doesn't influence the popup behaviour.
</p><p><br>
Looking at the console in the popup there are a few 'Unable to find window by ref window.js:148:14' errors.
</p><p>In the 'host' window where the popup was called from the console displays the 'Failed to execute â€˜postMessageâ€™ on â€˜DOMWindowâ€™: The target origin provided (â€˜<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>â€™) does not match the recipient windowâ€™s origin (â€˜<a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>â€™).' error.
</p><p><br>
I believe this could be a recent issue because I was able to make several payments last month with all settings the same.
I have a separate user.js file that I keep my settings in (I can send it over if required). These settings have not been changed since the file has been created.
</p><p><br>
The following actions have been tried and didn't improve the situation:
</p><p>- refreshing the current profile
</p><p>- disabling all addins
</p><p>- adding <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> into exclusions for 'Block pop-up windows' and Enhanced Tracking Protection
</p><p>- cleaning History and cookies
</p><p><br>
I then launched Firefox with a separate 'clean' profile and was able to make the payment successfully. Sure enough, importing my user.js file broke PayPal. I went through the settings commenting them out by groups.
</p><p>The following setting was causing the issue:
</p><p>user_pref(""privacy.firstparty.isolate"", true);
</p><p>Setting it to 'false' made the PayPal popup window work correctly again.
</p><p>Thought that this would be helpful for anyone experiencing similar issues. Cheers.

Seems odd that this problem occurred just after the latest release was installed.  I have no other issues with Firefox.  No other changes have been made to Firefox other than the upgrade to 72.0.1.  I looked through the forums but could find no information on this problem nor were there any similar problems.  I also went through the FAQ's and found no solutions that made any sense in relationship to the problem I am experiencing.  Am out of ideas now.  Thanks for any help that is offered...
