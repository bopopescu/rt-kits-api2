for some reason after I created a new user account I'am getting weird rendering issues with Firefox (V.72.0.1)  at random times and sites. I've already reinstalled Firefox...

At the time these issues occurred I was always on the latest Driver version of Nvidia for the 2080Ti and the latest version of Windows 10. Any idea what could be causing these issues?

How to delay the installation of automatic updates by 15 days (for example) ?
I'd like to avoid issues with new features in a business environment. I know ESR may be a solution but :
- I can't switch from RR to ESR when I want due to the profiles issue (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profiles-firefox-installation#w_what-happens-to-my-profile-if-i-downgrade-to-a-previous-version-of-firefox)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profiles-firefox-installation#w_what-happens-to-my-profile-if-i-downgrade-to-a-previous-version-of-firefox)</a>.
- Every new major version of ESR may contain features that break compatibility with my applications.
Thanks in advance.
