Our internal Thycotic Secret Server is one of these endpoints, and SS runs over IIS. I have many, many servers in our environment that are bound to these certificates, and they work just fine in Firefox. The cert for the Secret Server is just like all of the other certs in our enterprise. The certificate is fully valid and trusted in IE, Edge, Chrome and in Firefox. We have GPO's in place to ensure the CA Root Authority of our PKI and issuing server is trusted and the certs are compliant, fully standard and functional in all web browsers. 
</p><p>But this one server absolutely WILL NOT bring up a web page when we browse to Secret Server in Firefox. It stops cold with a PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR, and there is no option to bypass it whatsoever. We don't have these issues with other servers using the same type of certs. We don't have this issue with any other browsers - only Firefox. I've even generated a wildcard cert that works everywhere on our internal domain, in all browsers, but if I bind it in IIS on the Secret Server, it just won't work.
</p><p>I've worked with Thycotic support, and they have no solutions, only to point their fingers at the browser, because the error is in the browser, and not from the web server (even though they can't see any errors from the web server, because no page ever gets displayed.
</p><p>I'm stumped on this, and because it works everywhere except for this browser on this server (and this happens on ANY workstation in our environment - existing or brand new Firefox install), I can't understand what is causing this. Is there anything I can look at in some logs, config file or somewhere else? 
</p><p>I did see an option in the SS config to disable HSTS, and I tried to disable that, but it didn't make any difference. I'm still fully inclined to point the finger at Thycotic and their software, but since they can't replicate the issue on their end, they refuse to accept any ownership in resolving this.
</p><p>If anyone has anything to offer, I would greatly appreciate it. I would really like Firefox to be my one and only daily driver web browser, but because the server that serves up the passwords for the accounts, endpoints and websites in our environment doesn't work, it kinda makes it difficult to use, or recommend to others.

I toggle between two pages.  The ""View Page"" and the ""Edit Page"".  But whenever I am on the ""View Page"" inside of the Pinned Tab and click on a page link that would change it to the ""Edit Page"", it opens the ""Edit Page"" in a new tab instead of the current one.
</p><p>I am aware that there is a browser.link.open_newwindow (default is 3, where 1 is the current tab, 2 is new window, and 3 is new tab) and a browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction (default is 2, where 0 is all, 1 is none, and 2 is only special windows) setting on the about:config page.
</p><p>It was suggested to change browser.link.open_newwindow to 1 (current tab) and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0 (all).
</p><p>When I do this, it does make the ""Edit Page"" link open up in the same Pinned Tab as the ""View Page"" that I am already on.  But it also causes all of the links in all the other tabs (not Pinned) to also open up in the same tab instead of a new one.  I know that holding down keys like CTRL might help with that, but I also have programs that open up pages when clicked on (you can't hold down CTRL when clicking on the system tray icon).  For example, Howard E-Mail Notifier will open up my Yahoo Mail in the same tab with these settings instead of a new tab.
</p><p>I REALLY don't want to hold down CTRL for links or go through any other hassle or BS.  I just want to see if there is a settings or a way to make it so that links in normal tabs (not Pinned) open up in new tabs, and links in Pinned Tabs open up in the same Pinned tab.  If it isn't possible, fine.  But I thought that I would ask.  Thanks.

The problem is, the setting in question just keeps resetting to ""true"" on its own after each and every browser update, so I had to manually change it back to ""false"" after FF69 update, FF70 update, FF71 update and FF72 update, basically 4 additional times already if not even more (I don't quite remember about XX.0.1 types of updates).
It's frankly getting ridiculous and extremely annoying by that point. Is there a way to stop FF from screwing my ""about:config"" settings without my consent?

If you want to open links in Gmail (with a normal, left click) in a new window, you type about:config in the search bar, accept, then search browser.link.open_newwindow and set the value to 2. This will open clicked Gmail links in new window.

Aunque tengo mi firefox sincronizado con mi cuenta, cada vez que inicio el explorador o habro una pestaña nueva, es como si recien hubiera instalado firefox. Ejemplo: abro facebook, me sale la pagina de bienvenida donde me pide mi nombre de usuario y contraseña, firefox me las muestra, las selecciono, inicio sesion en facebook yse me pide que selecciona una opcion para que no se me pida de nuevo las contraseñas. Cierro firefox y lo abro de nuevo y no esta el historial, si voy a facebook, tengo que repetir todo el proceso. Pasa lo mismo con mercadolibre, gmail y otras que necesita inicio de sesion.
No guarda historial ni inicios de sesion, pero si dice que esta sincronizado con mi cuenta de firefox.
Alguien tiene alguna idea de que pasa? 
Alguna solución?

Users were no longer able to write comments for their bookmarks.
Firefox said that websites accessing bookmarks, could  also read comments which could contain personal information such as logins and passwords etc.
</p><p>For that reason FIrefox team decided to force users ditch comment section.
</p><p>The problem here is not the comments but the fact that bookmarks are accessible to other websites.
Firefox is not just allowing but had implemented an API for websites to access bookmarks.
This was done so that websites can crawl your bookmarks and push ads based on what they find.
It may also be a government imposed function. Either one.
</p><p>So now that thousands of users personal information was exposed to unknown websites accessing their bookmakrs, firefox resolved this with ""taking feature away"" ? instead of ""remove bookmakrs reading by websites"" ?
</p><p>WTF ?
I have no words to describe this moral corruption. They purposly created a function that allows websites to access your bookmarks comments. After enough information was shared they decided to pull the plug to make them selves look good as ""we care about your privacy"" ?
What the hell are you talking about ?
YOu care about my privacy ? STOP websites from reading my bookmarks !!!!!!!!!!!
Websites should have NO access to ANYTHING. They should not know what browser i have, they should not know what bookmarks i have.

</p><p>My Firefox browser (72.0, 64-bit, Win8.1) became slower at loading pages with the previous update, and I've noticed that it's caused by the same problem on each page to varying degrees. I'll click on a page to load it, then the black 'finding' dot on the tab will bobble about a bit, then it turns to the blue 'connecting' dot and keeps loading for minutes. At the bottom left the page will say 'Looking up...' and will start off with the right or at least a reasonable address, such as <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a> etc, but then it will keep going and come up with a load of random pages that all seem connected with adverts, tracking or monitoring. For example, looking up '<a href=""http://www.ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ikea.com</a>' took 4 minutes 23 seconds from entering it to it loading fully. In that time covered the following:

I think .json are and a few others I recognize but it looks like there are thousands of files here and I don't want to recover everything as my hard drive will be filled.  
</p><p>And how do I prevent my (small) C drive from filling up in the Users area?  I have the browser installed on D drive but I can't remember if I attempted to install it as a portable installation.  I think that might prevent the Users area filling up on C driver or would it fill up on a portable install?  I don't even know if Mozilla offers a portable install.  I just hate it when software scatters files all over the place.  I want everything Firefox related in one folder.   Most of the time software is like a filing system where you place your carefully organized papers into a tray and its shot out spewing the contents all over the room.

</p><p>I don't understand why this is constantly an issue with Firefox. Every single time, every update, every install, it always and continually becomes an issue with websites that I visit with Firefox. Even a completely fresh install with that above-mentioned setting, it's still an issue--nothing to do with customization of any kind, it's just that Firefox isn't doing what it's supposed to do.
</p><p>What's going on here with this? Why isn't Firefox able to stop autoplay of videos within Facebook? I shouldn't have to rely on website settings to turn something like that off when it's the browser that allows the playback. I'm clearly missing something (I guess) so I'd appreciate if someone can shine some light on this because it's infuriating.

</p><p>Symptom: One day, out of nowhere and not pursuant to any user-initiated Firefox installation, configuration or plugin change, a deterministic set of websites begins to crash tabs immediately on page load.  Reloading the same website always results in another immediate crash.  If the website at a particular URL crashes a tab, it will never load or reload, because it will always crash the tab it is in.  Websites not in the set of websites which crash a tab are unaffected.  Restarting Firefox does not fix the problem - the same sites crash tabs after restart.  Disabling ASLR does not fix the problem.
</p><p>I first observed this on a Mac OS X laptop (Macbook Pro 2017) running up-to-date Firefox versions at the time.  This happened three times in the last six months.  As I did not have time to investigate at the time, and observed that merely reinstalling Firefox from upstream archives cleared the problem, I moved on.
</p><p>Starting yesterday, I began to observe this on my up-to-date x86-64 Ubuntu Eoan laptop:

</p><p>No mitigation I attempted worked until I remembered reinstallation.  On a Linux box?  Seriously?  Follow me (in the attachment, since this forum doesn't support markdown or any sane way of formatting).
</p><p>By all appearances, a 64-bit word in the middle of the libxul binary was altered by some process which did not affect its mtime.  Since Firefox apparently does not validate its components on startup or at any other time, this went undetected and resulted in that code crashing the process whenever it was reached.
</p><p>I have to say this is a bit disconcerting because I have no explanation at all for this - the package on the machine where I did the investigation was installed in a routine automatic update weeks ago and only yesterday began to exhibit the described symptoms.  Perhaps it was corrupted (by CPU heat? memory? disk firmware? cosmic ray?  No MCE events have been logged) when it was written out, and I happened not to visit a website which reached the corrupted code until yesterday.  That seems unlikely since the crash has happened very frequently since yesterday on a variety of websites:
</p><p>$ sudo zgrep libxul /var/log/kern.log | wc -l
</p><p>32
</p><p>There is a prior bug report describing a similar experience here: <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/20100</a>
For what it's worth, a coworker on another team at my company also ran into these symptoms and mitigated it on his corporate laptop simply by reinstalling.
</p><p>Is there a way to mine the automated crash reporter data to see if this is an emerging trend of some kind?
