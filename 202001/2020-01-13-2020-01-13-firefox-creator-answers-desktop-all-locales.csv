</p><pre>   Prefercence Name signon.rememberSignons

<p>and want to change it. I looked for the origin of the setting and decided to delete those files:
</p><pre>* C:/Users/myuser/AppData/Local/Downloaded Apps/Firefox/autoupd/App/Firefox/mozilla.cfg

</pre>
<p>Some of those (mozilla.cfg;cache2/enctries/) files contained the value
</p><pre>   lockPref(""signon.rememberSignons"", false);
</pre>
<p>.
</p><p>I am not able to alter the setting signon.rememberSignons; It is still locked. There are no Microsoft Group Policies in enforcement; What holds the setting in locked state?
