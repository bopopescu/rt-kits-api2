Today I wanted to update my tablet with the same icon shortcuts &amp; favorite bookmarks.  When I tried to find this option to make the tablet the same interface as the desktop, I couldn't find any settings on the tablet to do that so, I wanted to go to the sync account to try matching up the tablet and when I tried to sign-in my password was no longer recognized - I hadn't changed it so, after 3 separate tries to log-in, I did a password reset.  When I went to my e-mail account there was ""NO"" e-mail from Firefox for the reset at all.  I have uninstalled Firefox on my tablet &amp; phone and am only using the desktop for now.  Is there anyway to get a reset or at least create a new account using my current e-mail address?  Why is there no e-mail ""reset"" coming from Firefox?

I use Firefox on an Android tablet where I never change the bookmarks, and on my laptop where I change them very often.

This was on my laptop. Being afraid that reconnecting to sync would install the bookmarks from the Tablet on the laptop I disconnected from sync. But this was 2 days ago!!!
Can this have caused the bookmarks suddenly disappearing?

Problem then persists if other apps are closed, leaving only FF running.  The problem seems to build relatively soon after each restart when the HDD starts persistent activity even when nothing much being actively used.  Previously would leave system running for weeks before any signs of restart being preferable.
Thorough scans, check on drive capacity, file integrity and fragmentation levels, clearing cookies and site data, etc don't reveal anything amiss.     It could of course be unrelated to FF such as if any conflict between Bitdefender and Win10 inbuilt security though none reported.    Open tabs are typically held over a restart.  restarts can be quite slow as though some temp cache being cleared.
