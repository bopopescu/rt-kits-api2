On the switch to Quantum, I felt the loss of Session Manager in particular, and finally settled on OneTab. On my work machine (Windows), I make semi-regular profile backups, and every once in a while I archive the current backup. On the upgrade to FFX 70 in October 2019, I lost all OneTab entries. (I apparently was not alone.) I immediately archived the most recent profile backup. I have tried a couple of times since then to figure out how to retrieve the OneTab data from the profile archive, but have always failed. I tried again this week, and am still failing. I contacted the OneTab development team via their website, but they never responded. Their information at  <a href=""https://www.one-tab.com/firefoxRestore"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.one-tab.com/firefoxRestore</a> is outdated. </p><p>In the archived profile, under browser-extension-data\extension@one<a href=""http://-tab.com"" rel=""nofollow"">-tab.com</a> I find the file storage.js.migrated, which was created when the extensions changed their storage location to the IndexedDB. It is dated to March 25, 2019. I could retrieve entries from that file, but I would not recover the many tabs saved between March and October 2019. </p><p>This week, I uninstalled Firefox, set the current Firefox profile aside by renaming it, extracted the October 2019 profile to make it the current profile, went offline, installed Firefox 69.0.2, started Firefox, and displayed the OneTab overview page. Unfortunately, it was empty, so I restored the current FFX version and profile. </p><p>After more research, I very hopefully reviewed the instructions given at: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1275126"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1275126</a> </p><p>I then performed them carefully using the folder from the archived profile, but on restarting Firefox, I got the same result, an empty OneTab overview page. The sqlite file from the archive under storage\default\moz-extension+++2ce1f1a7-d4cf-41cb-b92d-3d450b7812b4^userContextId=4294967295\ is dated October 8, 2019, but is only 56 kB. When I open it in an editor (like Notepad++), it does contain text snippets recognizable as references to many of the tabs I had stored. </p><p>How can I recover the information from this profile archive? </p><p>My desire to use OneTab faltered after this incident and their lack of support, but I have been putting off reducing the number of open tabs until I recover my lost tabs. I am also open to any suggestions what to use for tab management after I recover. </p>",tabs;firefox-750;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1306662;,atat1

I also have Local Security Policy set to treat any connection as Public and cannot be changed by user.

Again, this was a clean install. All other firefox sytem folders were also removed prior to re-installing. Program files, appdata, etc. all deleted prior to installing.  </p><p>After trying some things with no luck I found out that If you import your firefox bookmarks to chrome and re-load the bookmarks in chrome the icon refreshed to the correct one. I did that for all missing icons. I then exported the bookmarks as html, but before I imported them back into firefox i completely removed history and all bookmarks once again, and then restarted firefox. </p><p>Once firefox opened I imported the bookmark html from chrome and sure enough it worked. The bookmark icons were back to normal. To test i reloaded the page and even restarted firefox and they were all still ok. There is def an issue in firefox that prevents bookmark icons from refreshing properly. Hopefully the team will take a look into this and get a patch to firefox.  </p><p>I already fixed the issue but I wanted to post here to report my findings in case this was a bug?

Since then I have had trouble viewing ebay items.  After you do a ebay search a list of items show up.  When you open an item from a search list, you get a photo of the item usually on the left side and a description below the photo item.  However, below and after the description everything including other seller photos and text are on the left side of the page.  Normally they are across the page from the left side to right side.  But now the layout is all on the left side.  Everything is against the left side only and very hard to read.  For many years I have never run into this problem before.  I signed off and restarted Ebay with same problem.  Looked at my son's computer and the ebay layout looked correct like like mine use to.  I also opened up my google chrome browser and signed onto ebay.  The ebay photos and text were correctly located on the page.   So it appears that the recent update to firefox will not display the correct layout format in ebay.  Can I download to the previous version of firefox?  I 'm using latest Firefox browser 75.0 and running Windows 10.  I attached a screen shot photo. </p>",download-and-install_1;firefox-750;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1306357;1306587;,glennsaddress
