Whenever I tested on iPhone and iPad sizes through Firefox's RDM, the behaviour I was getting was far from what I expected. Then it dawned on me to try it on other browsers. Shockingly, it worked as expected. On Chrome and Safari sticky bar was sticking to the bottom (on FF, it's pushed way down, so can't even be seen on the screenshot. Also, putting them side by side, it's noticeable the size difference from the FF render. I did check my zoom levels (this is actual size) and minimum font (none), so I don't think this is a local configuration issue. I love the dev tools in FF, and find them much better for handling design overall, but this issue really threw me for a loop. </p><p>For reference, this was on FF 75.0 (64-bit) with Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 11_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/604.1.34 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/11.0 Mobile/15A5341f Safari/604.1. </p><p>Is this a known browser issue? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",taly.hotimsky
