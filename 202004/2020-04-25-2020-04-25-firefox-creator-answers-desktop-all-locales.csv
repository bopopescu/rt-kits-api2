The primary reason for running it in a browser at all is that I can design an interface fairly quickly in html and css. I don't intend to run this on a webserver (though it would of course be possible to do so). Now initially everything would simply fit in the html, but later I moved the javascript portion into separate files. This all worked well, until I wanted to switch to using ecmascript 6 modules. Simply adding the type=""module"" attribute breaks everything since my sourced script tags trigger the error described in <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp</a>. </p><p>Now I understand the reasoning behind that change, but I do believe the behaviour in this context is very strange and definitely inconsistent. I believe the underlying cause may be related to the fact that javascript modules are loaded asynchronously while scripts are loaded synchronously. </p><p>I could (and probably will) change my configuration to allow the loading of resources from the same directory again (I am aware of the risks), but how is loading a <strong>static</strong> resource asynchronously any more dangerous than loading said static resource synchronously? </p>",firefox-750;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sniperrifle2004+mozilla

God may have the patience to change Firefox theme of his laptop, sync his other computer, and change both of his computer's theme to the ""default"" one. He might then change both of his computer's and laptop's themes, and turn on his raspberry pi, and all the three computers now has the ""default"" theme. </p><p>These things were like this for ages. I think I am wrong thinking sync shouldn't work this way. Say in google, when you type something, it's saved to your search history, you remove it from one device, then it's gone from all the devices. But maybe Firefox devs think sync is merely syncing all the devices together. </p><p>There should be a timestamp in sync. When you change one theme in the future, you should change it for all the devices. You shouldn't change your laptop's theme to the desktop ones again because simply it should override the theme on the Firefox server. </p><p>""Tis strange - but true; for truth is always strange; Stranger than fiction"" </p><p>Yes, yes, reality is strange, changing a thing in Firefox in future syncs all the works from the past. It's messes up everything, the data isn't updated to the server, rather I don't know what kind of convoluted thing it does to perplex mere humans. </p><p>What do you think?

If you delete many histories, Firefox will slowly consume all your system's available RAM unless you kill it, ok fine, probably Firefox is written the inefficient way. </p><p>Then I turned on my raspberry Pi. And all my hard-work of deleting history got synced with my laptop. Ok I deleted them again. </p><p>Then I turned on my Computer... Oh No! Again it got synced... They say patience is the key to success (here success is deleting histories). </p><p>Then I realized that I had a tonne of virtual machines, I use them once a month maybe. Executing Firefox on them would sync them again or so. So I had to put myself in a state of meditation to remind my subconscious mind to remember to delete the ~/.mozilla/ directory whenever I open my virtual machines. </p><p>I am a mere human, I might not have patience like the Firefox devs, I can't waste months deleting histories, I have other works to do. So  I went to the Firefox sign in page, signed in, disconnected all the devices, removed the ~/.mozilla/ directory, then logged in again, synced, deleted histories, and then slowly I singed in to all the devices. </p><p>In Firefox, forgiving your past is not that easy.
