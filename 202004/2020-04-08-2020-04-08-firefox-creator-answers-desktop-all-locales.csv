All other programs are working fine, which might cast doubt on hardware/graphics issues. </p><p>ISSUE: When I make a new tab, whether with Ctrl+T or ""+"" tab button, or even Ctrl+Shift+T for opening a working tab I closed recently, the tab will be useless.  I know this will happen because either (a) the tab doesn't show the firefox new tab page, but a gray screen, (b) the address bar will not respond, (c) one or both of the previous, and a small yellow box pops up for less than a second that says ""a script is causing your page to slow down..""--this bar goes away immediately; I had to take a screenshot to read it.  There is no notification of a crash other than this brief bar.  Sometimes an existing tab will freeze, demonstrating the page until I scroll, whereupon new parts scrolled to of the page are just gray, and even old parts that have been scrolled off-screen come back gray, and the page is effectively an image since it's unresponsive, and even typing a new page into the URL bar doesn't do anything. </p><p>What makes this particularly disruptive is that by seemingly random chance and independent of the site being visited, the tab will be useless.  The tab can't be made to work again, it will be frozen until closed and another tab created.  This happens more than 50% of the time and either has gotten worse or more annoying to me over time.  Usually I will middle click a link ten times and open one of 1-3 tabs that worked.  Recently I closed several tabs but wanted to restore one, so I spammed Ctrl+Shift+T, but half the tabs were broken and irrecoverable (except through History). </p><p>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I reset firefox and updated everything for this post.  I have no addons installed, and the plugins are OpenH264 (1.8.1.1), Shockwave Flash (32.0.0.344), and Widevine Content Decryption Module (4.10.1582.2).  There are no recent crash reports in about:crashes. </p><p>Super looking forward to fixing this, the browser is unusable in its current state.  Worth mentioning, this also happens on my Windows machine, but I'd like to fix it first on Linux unless Windows is helpful for diagnosis. </p>",firefox-740;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",helasraizam
