One feature I'm trying to setup with FF is search engine query URL shortcuts. Basically, it allows the user to type a letter and it auto enables that URL. In this case, we're using Reddit. Basically, it allow us to type 'R' followed by a space which then auto populates the query URL. We can then type in our requested subreddits. However, I haven't been able to get this to work with FF. The search engine function add-on in firefox only enables a general search instead of subreddit specific. Would love to hear any feedback and/or solutions.
