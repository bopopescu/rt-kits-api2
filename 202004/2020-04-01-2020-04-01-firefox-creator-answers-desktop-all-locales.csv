With the advent of Covid-Home-Schooling-Online I need to secure the Windows laptop for an 8 yr old. I already use Firefox and am researching best methods of making safe for kids. Options so far are installing Parental Control Addins that I am warned is 'NOT A RECOMMENDED EXTENSION' and for which the website offers little in information about their provenance. Is there really not a Mozilla Firefox web blocker? I've considered switching Windows to Parental Controls mode but this requires using a MS family account - which leads to my subject question: does MS not then track and utilise an awful lot of usage and info about my child then? I find it hard to understand why a Firefox feature requires an MS account - as Prefer:Safe cannot be switched on without it - so I assume Mozilla has verified and passed the MS account system as non intrusive...? </p>,firefox-740;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1301982;,firefox_20200401

Not able to tab or side arrow over.  Other apps work fine and now I'm using Chrome because it doesn't do this. Firefox on my other Windows 7 computer doesn't do this.

I am doing this via the ExtensionSettings policy within the Firefox templates v1.14 </p><p>I have successfully made the default behavior to block plugins, using this string: </p><pre>   ""*"": {    ""blocked_install_message"": ""Extension is not whitelisted. Please contact IT Support"",    ""install_sources"": [""<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/</a>""],    ""installation_mode"": ""blocked""  } </pre> <p>I'm even able to successfully whitelist plugins on the mozilla addon page, example below: </p><pre>   ""support@lastpass.com"": {    ""installation_mode"": ""allowed"",    ""install_url"": ""<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/</a>""  } </pre> <p>My problem is I can't seem to whitelist any plugins that are installed from any source other than Mozilla. For example, Dashlane is only available via their website. I tried the following, but it still says blocked. </p><pre>   ""jetpack-extension@dashlane.com"": {    ""installation_mode"": ""allowed"",    ""install_url"": ""<a href=""https://www.dashlane.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dashlane.com/en/</a>""  } </pre> <p>I have run into the same issue with another plugin, even when using the full URL of the .xpi file. I've played around with this for a good few hours, but nothing seems to work.  Any advice? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox-740;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1301745;,Nick.Rogers
