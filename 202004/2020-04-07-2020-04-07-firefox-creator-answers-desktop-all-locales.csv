To get this research back, I am using Sync - but none of the original windows was preserved.  Instead there is just a long list of all of the tabs I had open across all the windows I had open.  Why does Sync not preserve the separate windows?  With well over a hundred tabs open, this makes recovering/accessing this information very tedious - as all the tabs have to be opened individually, and then sorted into separate windows again, to be bookmarked in their search subject categories/windows!  Was this just an oversight, or is it technically not possible to preserve separate windows in Sync?   </p><p>If it is technically not possible to preserver multiple windows of tabs in Sync, it would be much more workable if it were possible to mark these tabs in Sync to re-open them, rather than have to open them individually or all of the tabs at once from that other machine.
