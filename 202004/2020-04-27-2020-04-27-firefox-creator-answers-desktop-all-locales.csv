At first it was off by several hours but then I tried setting new Date().toString(); to false in about:config, which I've seen on several threads as a solution. After doing that the browser time is only ahead by one hour compared to my local actual time but it's still off. Everything on my local settings is correct. </p><p>When I check the time on the web console it returns the wrong time, the time is ahead by one hour. The timezone is wrong too, it returns Atlantic Daylight Time when it should be AST or ET. My guess is this has something to do with daylight savings time(maybe?) We don't do that where we live so this would be all useless for me. </p><p>Did not worked: Restarting with add ons disabled. Force setting the timezone with 2 different addons. </p><p>I will appreciate any help or suggestions. </p>",firefox-750;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1308944;1308948;1308953;,mercedago

In my Firefox setting selected option is restoring of previous session. But sometimes (NOT EVERYtime) it open on seperate windows the two ordinary bookmarks - each time they are the same two sites (let's call them ""problem sites""). These sites have never been chosed for my starting page or something like that. I tried to understand the system files in ""Mozilla \ Firefox \ Profiles"", but I could not understand the syntax. I find my ""problem sites"" along with other bookmarks in session's and recovery's files - that's all with my knowledge =( I tried to reinstall Firefox with full clean of user's files, but after I restored my setting with profile synchronization and restoring bookmarks via ""speed dial"" extension, and my problem was restored too. </p><p>I'm sorry for my English, it's my first try to explain a complex technical trouble. In case with russian speaking users I write original text: Иногда (но не всегда!) при запуске Firefox у меня открывается два отдельных окна, в каждом из которых по одному сайту из моих закладок. При этом окно с восстановленной сессией открывается тоже, с ним всё нормально. Характерно, что каждый раз, когда это всё таки происходит - это одна и та же пара сайтов. По-английски не смог сформулировать, но это самые обычные сайты, с ними не связаны какие-то расширения браузера, у них нет особых разрешений или чего-то в таком роде; они никогда не были стартовыми. Это началось довольно давно, и я не помню, чем я мог вызвать эту проблему. Иногда этой фигни не происходит неделями =\ Я пытался переустановить браузер с полной очисткой пользовательских файлов, но потом отсинхронил настройки через аккаунт Firefox и закладки через расширение ""speed dial"" - вместе с какой-то из синхронизаций вернулась и проблема. Я даже Винду за это время менял (с 7ой до 10 версии). </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1308975;,stigmated

Maybe someone can come up with better captions, but you get the idea. </p><p>For example: I drag a link to a folder on the toolbar. I then have to click to open the toolbar, find the new link, edit properties. To re-sort the folder, I have to the right-click on the folder (which closes it!) and choose ""Sort by Name"". Then, to see the results, I have to reopen the folder and find the link again!
