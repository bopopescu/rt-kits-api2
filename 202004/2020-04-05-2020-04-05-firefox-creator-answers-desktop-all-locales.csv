I read it, but I'm not sure it's applicable when embedded in Fx. </p><p>I've searched a lot how to do it &amp; there's not much info.  Honestly, unless someone advanced enough to look at their instructions could simplify it, it's possible the fastest way is change the  default theme colors in codemirror.css, then repack omni.ja.  Codemirror mentions that method, but again, I think they're talking if it's freestanding or backend for some text editor, not embedded in a browser. </p><p>I'm not sure userChrome will work because it's not really part of Fx.

The idea is to start the video streaming, ""stop it / Pause it"" and wait for a while then restart it. This way it would not make any pauses when the streaming is too slow. I check already the post: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1168957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1168957</a> I work with the version 74.0 (64 bit). I set up in the ""config"": </p> <ul><li> media.cache_readhead_limit to 9999 </li><li> media.cache_resume_threshold to 9999 </li><li> media.cache_size  to 512000000 (instead of 512000) </li></ul> <p>It looks like the buffer never keeps the video data after ""loading"" part or all of the video! 1- After a very long time the video is frozen and does not restart. 2- After a while I can restart the video (halting the PAUSE, returning to PLAY) but the internet traffic of the loading of the streaming is also restarting with break times as slow connection. I ran a few experiences by checking the ""Internet Traffic"" when the only activity of my home connection is the video streaming. </p><p>Is there a way to config Firefox for retaining the whole entire video stream into the video buffer and watch the video without any break during the PLAY? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help and answer. Best regards. </p><p>Richard. </p>",firefox-740;customize;desktop;,firefox,customize,en-US,1302719;,Richard51

Small JSONs are stored directly in SQLite DB, bigger ones - as a files with integer numbers as names. It's IndexedDB functionality, it's transparent for addons. As far as I understand after the last update to v74 something went wrong with this addon DB. Addon showed ""IndexedDB Error"". I saved DB files, reinstalled the addon and it works fine again. So now I want to restore my old sessions. SQLite file opens normally using DB Browser, for ex. Separate JSON files seems to be OK also. The problem is that both separate JSON files and JSON data in SQLite DB are not plain text JSON, but kind of binary data containing JSON. How could I extract if from there? </p>",firefox-740;other;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1302681;1302775;,cool_man2k3

Thankfully, I was able to save my files, including my old Firefox profile. Trouble is, when I try to restore that profile, I can't get my old browsing history to hang around for longer than about a minute, even though all my other settings are in place. </p><p>To be crystal clear about what I'm doing and experiencing: </p><p>1. I have my old profile saved on a flash drive. I replace the contents of the existing folder in AppData &gt; Firefox &gt; Profiles with the contents of my old profile from the flash drive. 2. I open Firefox to my old profile's bookmarks, settings, homepage, etc, INCLUDING my browsing history. It's all there. 3. I close Firefox, wait ~30 seconds and reopen it. My bookmarks etc, INCLUDING my browsing history, is still there. 4. I close Firefox again, wait another 30 seconds, and reopen Firefox. My bookmarks etc. are there, EXCLUDING my history, which is gone, and there's only a folder for ""Today"" with my homepage in it and nothing else.  </p><p>I've done this process several times with identical results. It won't erase my history while Firefox is open, but if I close the browser and then reopen it again after (approximately) 60 seconds has passed, my history is gone. I'd very much like to have my history back and not have it constantly delete itself every minute or so. How do I fix this? </p><p>It's worth noting that I restored this same exact profile on my last machine several years ago, and didn't have this problem. </p>",download-and-install_1;firefox-740;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1302729;1302816;1302842;1302910;1302929;,taran1
