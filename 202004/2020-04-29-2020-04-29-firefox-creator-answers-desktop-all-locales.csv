Whenever I try to hover over the corners of the window to resize it, the cursor never changes over to the double arrows to enable resizing it. If I try clicking and dragging anyway, it only moves it around, just like clicking and dragging from anywhere else inside the window. I have no idea why this is happening, and reinstalling firefox doesn't fix the problem. I am working in Linux with Kubuntu version 18.04, and though I finally took notice of it now, I believe I had the problem in earlier versions of firefox on this device as well. I am wondering if it might have to do with KDE or Ubuntu in some way, but I am a beginner to Linux and was hoping to rule out a more common issue first before chalking it up to my platform/ OS. </p><p>Thanks a bunch in advance for any help or input anyone can give me! </p><p>Best, Tim </p>",firefox-750;customize;desktop;linux;,firefox,customize,en-US,1309203;1309365;1309410;1309433;,timothyanickell
