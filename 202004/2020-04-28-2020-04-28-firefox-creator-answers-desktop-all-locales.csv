1285625,2020-04-28 14:38:37 -0800,2020-04-29T02:34:53Z,where is the order of the search engines stored,"<p>Hi, I am using Firefox 75.0 on Windows 10. I changed the order of my serach engines in the preferences. In earlier versions of Firefox the installed search engines were stored in search.json.mozlz4 and the order somewhere in search-metadata.json, search.sqlite and search.json. So to move the search engines from one profil to another, one could copy those files and everything was as before. Now I only find search.json.mozlz4 in my profil and none of the other files. But just copying search.json.mozlz4 to a new profile, will restore the search engines but not the order I arranged them in. Are those other files not part of the profie anymore? </p><p>I have about 90 custom search engines and would like to do the job just once and not 10 times or more for my different installations. So how can I move not only the engines themselve but also their order? Thank you! </p>",firefox-520;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1309187;1309197;1309263;,servmail

I have not noticed anything systematic about the crashes.  I did Internet searches for this problem and scoured the help on the Support site, but could find not recent mentions of this problem and no real solutions when this problem was discussed in connection with early versions of Firefox.  Anyone else having this problem?  I hope someone can suggest some solutions.  By the way, my printer is a Brother MFC-L2700DW and I connect with it via USB.  I've also tried reinstalling/updating the printer drivers, but no joy.  My computer is a Dell N5110 running Win 7.  I'm not too savvy about capturing Firefox error logs, but will read up on it and have some info available if anyone asks.  Thanks. </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-7;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1309188;1309214;1309225;1309226;1309304;,lbecker

My telecomprovider offers me regularly the invoice in pdf-format. When I download it, the filename is changed into 8 characters, not being a sensible or readable name (ie ""7fH5Rsd3.pdf""). When I asked the the provider to change this, it was clear it already is. Other customers working with IE or Chrome etc. don't have this problem. It was suggested this could be Firefox itself. The strange thing is this happens only with this provider and apparantly only with me. Everywhere else pdf's or any other file downloads just fine with their respective names. So, what could be the cause? One obscure setting in Firefox? Or should I look elsewhere? BTW: this is happening with all previous versions of Firefox, but I don't know when it started. </p>",firefox-750;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1309152;1309204;,bankzilla

You are telling me:  ""This is not monitored for security through Mozilla's Recommended Extensions program. Make sure you trust it before installing."" How can I trust it if I don't know anything about it?? or if it is new? -Most of people here who are downloading add-ons are normal users like me, not people who understand codes and developing.- Read reviews?? Do I understand from you that some people have to sacrifice for us so the rest can know if it is bad or good add-on? And by the way Reading reviews is not enough, For example Few months ago I downloaded a VPN similar to another one, lots of reviews say it is good,  so I used it for maybe 1 month then I disabled it and stopped using it. Today I look at it in the disabled add-ons list, I find this message: ""VPN has been disabled due to security or stability issues."" I read more information about it, it turned out that it was executing remote codes....... That means I shouldn't even trust reviews!! Nothing happened to my firefox browser, but (it may happen) in the future, because of the already executed remote codes or or maybe those codes stole some information about me,....I don't know, but it may get worse who knows what those executed codes do..... </p> <h6 id=""w__2"">=============================</h6> <p>Now after I provided my (((important))) suggestion, I need an advice please what should I do now??
