Reinstalling it is turning out to be my biggest mistake. Instead of the version 63 installing, which is what my installer was for the installer is only installing the most recent buggy version My version 63 had updates turned off, it should not have taken an update but it did even though the updates were turned off FOR security. I even had the registry set to block from HKLM When I am 'browsing' the internet I am logged into my machine with a user account that can't even make any changes. The current version (76.0.1) is having the same problems that plagued me before after this 'ninja update', the cache will not fully clear. When I open firefox it is showing it has items cached. There should be NOTHING in the cache when it opens, I do not have a home page set, there are no links set to open at startup and no connections should be made. The popup blocker is not only not blocking any popups it is opening them in new windows The machine does not have a virus or malware. Why is firefox so insecure now? The whole idea of using firefox was to be using a secure browser and just a browser it is not supposed to be integrated into the operating system it is not supposed to be interacting with the operating system it is supposed to be an internet browser. Without the ability to prevent this automatic communication and block unwanted traffic from it we may as well be using Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome.  How do we install one of the older more secure versions of Firefox without it automatically updating at the time of the install? How do we actually block the automatic communication? How do we block popups as the popup blocker does not work at all? (it worked beautifully in version 63) How do we get it to clear the cache at exit and open with the cache at 0? </p>",privacy-and-security_1;desktop;firefox-760;windows-81;needsinfo;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1312955;1312957;1312959;1313242;1313243;1313245;,sh00p3r
