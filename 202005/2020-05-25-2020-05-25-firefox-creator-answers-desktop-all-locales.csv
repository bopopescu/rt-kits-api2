First image: 2 tabs, Yahoo mail, calendar = 1 GB of memory, 59% of CPU.  Second image: 3 tabs, Yahoo mail, calendar, FB = 1.5 GB of memory, 55% of CPU.  Third image: 1 tab, blank, after closing the other tabs = 725 MB of memory, 52% of CPU(!) </p><p>At this stage, the <strong>very latest</strong> version of Chrome is actually less resource-heavy than this version of FF. </p><p>I went ahead and did an experiment: <strong>exact same 6 tabs</strong> in Regular Mode vs. Safe Mode with add-ons disabled.
