The recent update (76), have broken my previous method of doing this.

For transparency, the code in that .cfg file looks like this: </p><p>// Do not remove this comment </p><p>var {classes:Cc,interfaces:Ci,utils:Cu} = Components; </p><p>var newTabURL = ""file:///path-to-my-page/index.html""; </p><p>aboutNewTabService = Cc[""@mozilla.org/browser/aboutnewtab-service;1""].getService(Ci.nsIAboutNewTabService); </p><p>aboutNewTabService.newTabURL = newTabURL; </p><p>Not sure how to put that in a code format on this forum.
