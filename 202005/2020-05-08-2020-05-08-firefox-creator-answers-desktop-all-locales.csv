Generally all works as desired.  However, intermittently (couple times a day ---&gt; once every few days) the browser simply, quietly refuses to allow the CAC to login, when I visit a CAC-secured site.  A browser dialog is presented and asks for my PIN, but closes without error, yet the PIN is not accepted and the site (correctly) refuses access.  In my troubleshooting, I found that if I look at the Security Devices tab under Privacy&amp;Security, the PKCS#11 module shows the CAC as not logged in.  If I attempt to log in at that page, I get the usual PIN dialog, but after submission, a new message box appears with the notice that ""Log in failed"", and I can see that module still says Log out.   </p><p>It appears that some file lock or related mechanism is in effect and needs to be reset.  The only solution I have been able to use is close Firefox completely (all windows), and restart.  This works but not desired as I have several different sites I'm active on, and each requires separate logins. </p><p>Any suggestions for further troubleshooting would be appreciated.  My forays into Google searches all end up as help to get CAC card working, which is not my problem.  The card works until Firefox (or something related in the middleware) freezes and the only recourse is to restart. </p><p>Cheers, --Jim </p>",privacy-and-security_1;firefox-750;desktop;linux;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jimparker96313

Upon start-up of either application, it seems to work for a few seconds but then the window locks in place and I can no longer move or resize the window.  With Thunderbird, even if I ""Restart with Add-ons Disabled"" the same problem continues.  With Firefox, opening new windows are locked in place as well.  What's going on?
