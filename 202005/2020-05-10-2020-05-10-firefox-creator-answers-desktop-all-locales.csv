I've been the victim of breaches.,"<p>I've had a hacker or whatever you would call someone who gets into my computer regularly. I have Malwarebytes Virus Protection and am going to get MWB Privacy. My debit card has been frozen x 15 days now without their sending me a new one. What this thug does is go to my email account, sign in as me, and tell them he/I forgot the password. Then he can verify it, and then he does the same thing. For about four months, he came and went, and all he did was change all my passwords. No matter what kind of secure p/w I used, he could always change it. On 04/26, I saw a charge on my debit card for $1.00 from FacebookPay or whatever, a verification charge. I immediately called FBPay and told them that was a fraudulent charge. I asked them to close the FBPay account. They did, but they also, without my permission, froze my card. I immediately reported that to the bank but they were busy merging with another bank, and they lie, so I still don't have access to my stimulus check or my last two paychecks. New bank is assuring me it's in the mail.  Naturally, I want to know what to do when I get my new debit card so the thug won't see it. I figure I can either order things I need from Amazon and eBay and then delete the card, or I could call them and give them the card info. I've been told I need to have this computer wiped clean, but that would leave me with no means of communication or getting my money out, since they only let you get $500 a day.. How do I deal with this thug? Thank you. I don't know much about computers. I'm considering taking it back to the store where I bought it and demanding one exactly like it or better but I don't know if that would go over or not. I can't pay rent, buy food, pay any bills, or do anything because the debit card people have all my money. I need to resolve the problem of my thug before I set up a new computer.
