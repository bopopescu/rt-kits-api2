How to shorten?","<p>Clicking the sandwich button brings up the primary menu, and its height seems to be determined by the size of my screen, and makes itself as tall as possible. Unfortunately, whatever it does to calculate this fails to take the height of my taskbar into account, probably because I have it two rows high. This causes the last items to be hidden. How can I fix this, other than constantly resizing the Windows taskbar? </p>",firefox-750;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",lenoxus

This along with the non standard shortcut key combos such as creating a private window using [Win + Shift + P] instead of [Win + Shift + N] doesn't make much sense. </p>",tabs;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1310719;,ZetiX

When I go to the change brightness section in Windows 10 I find that the balanced button is now checked instead of the high performance button that is normally checked. If I shut down Firefox the brightness returns to normal and the high performance button is checked. I have a 2019 MSI 17 inch laptop running Windows 10.  Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Jim Farrell </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jffarrell

This happens even with all extensions disabled and zoom reset (I attached two screenshots to show the difference, dark mode one is firefox, light mode is chrome).  I believe this may be a problem with Firefox in general, since it seems like a similar issue applies to other websites. For example, the Twitter sidebar has gotten big enough to need a scrollbar of its own (normally it doesnt need this). </p>",fix-problems;desktop;firefox-760;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1310698;1310706;,santiago.seibert
