How can I fix this?","<p>Whenever I open YouTube, the standard screen shows, including ads and videos, but whenever I try to watch a video by clicking on it, it takes me to the video's URL but the video screen itself is white, and does not have any features, such as play or the video's timebar. However, it still displays the title and comments and recommended videos. How do I fix this? This is only a FireFox issue, as I am still able to watch YouTube through Chrome.

</p><p>since last week, my saved logins have disappared. I tried with a win10 system recovery (there were 2 timestamps available): both didn't work, linked to a problem with Firefox profile (but error message doesn't show up fully so hard to see what is wrong).
</p><p>Via shadowexplorer, I was able to export the following files from previous system recovery backups: key3.db key4.db &amp; logins.json .
</p><p>If I copy these to a new (or existing profile), the logins.json file is renamed to logins.json.corrupt
</p><p>I have seen that there was a similar problem with AVG-users, but I run Comodo internet security premium...
</p><p>Any clues how to retrieve the logins??
