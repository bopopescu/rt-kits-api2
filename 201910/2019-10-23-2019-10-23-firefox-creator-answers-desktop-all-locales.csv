</p><p>Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it.  The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.
