</p><p>Well it's happening again. I believe that it was the last update before this one where I first encountered this problem and ended up having to completely reinstall Windows 10, which helped very little. Long story short, when that update took place my Toggle Keys were triggered and no matter what I do I can't turn them off. They're still like that. 
</p><p>Today, Firefox crashed all of a sudden and then updated itself. Right before it crashed though, I was having trouble with my mouse and keyboard arrows (only happens when Firefox is open). The mouse buttons and the down key weren't working. I can get the mouse to work for maybe a minute if I hold down CTRL for a few seconds, but then it craps out on me again. Also, the down arrow wouldn't scroll down. The up arrow worked fine, but the down arrow wouldn't and I would have to press it repeatedly to scroll. 
</p><p>And now it's doing what it was before I had no choice but to reinstall Windows. It's crashing nonstop. Sometimes it's just the tabs, sometimes it's the whole browser. 
</p><p>I also just used Task Manager to end Firefox because I was on Unsplash and the page was flickering and showing weird patterns and I couldn't get out of it. But I got a low memory error, but my memory said it was only at 47%! All that was open was Firefox, Photoshop, and 3 folders. I've never had a low memory error!
</p><p>I've restarted in safe-mode, disabled add-ons, and done all the other usual steps. And of course I had to install Firefox again after I reinstalled Windows. I'm at a loss. This is so frustrating and pretty much makes going on the internet impossible. I really need and would ever so much appreciate any help.
</p><p>Thank you

1271210,2019-10-23 20:37:02 UTC,2019-10-23T21:10:21Z,How do I force Firefox to use my present location and not a cached location?,"<p>I am a college student and I am required to use a website called Top Hat for one of my classes. With that website it requires access to my location in order to do secure attendance. Basically it asks for my location to check if you are in close proximity to other people in the class, i.e. if you are in lecture, and you didn't just get a friend to text you the code for attendance while you are at home. Here's the thing, for whatever reason in the version of firefox I am using firefox does not give top hat my current location, but rather gives my most recent location, which is usually from my home, off campus, thus marking me absent. This is what Top Hat support has told me, further on one occasion the location that was given was very far away while still in the state, which makes sense since I had just gotten back from a trip home that morning. 
</p><p>So here is the question, how do I force firefox to check for my location when prompted to, rather than use my most recent location that is cached somewhere in the browser, and if possible, can I disable this cache so that firefox does not store my location for long periods of time. Also, would restarting firefox force firefox to check my location again?
</p><p>I am using firefox 68.0. I upgraded from firefox 57.0 over this past summer, and I did not have this issue with top hat and location services prior to upgrading.

For a long time i was laging after the world, because i simply don't like current firefox user interface, even though i was using this browser since 1.0 version. However i was always somehow able to customize it the way i wanted.

But today update to version 68.2 broke everything i liked about the browser and things rearanged the way i hate. 
i am not dumb , i did try to get it back the way i wanted, but i got stuck on url bar placement, which is now imposible to move out of the navi toolbar.
For most of the work i have used <a href=""https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx</a> code, for user chrome customization , but even they don't have options for url bar to be undocked, moved or removed.
i was also trying to edit About:config toolbars order but after moving urlbar to different toolbar , for instance bookmarks or tabs string autocorect after restart and url bar is forced back on top.
is there any way to make navigation toolbat in 2 rows or move adres bar someplace else?

This generally works very well.
</p><p>The one issue I've struggled with is that since the removal of the ""never check for updates"" preference, the update behaviour of Firefox causes problems with multiple profiles.  I have it set to prompt for updates, and I install them immediately from my ""main"" profile, but the ""newer release is available"" window keeps popping up in the other running profiles.
</p><p>This is mostly just annoying.  However, if I accidentally accept the update in one of the other profiles, it then tries to update overtop of the already-updated Firefox and errors out.  I've had to reinstall from a full download because of this several times, which is a bigger problem.
</p><p>I've looked for ways to disable the check-for-updates behaviour in my secondary profiles, but this doesn't seem possible.  The only way to disable updates/checks for updates as I understand it is the enterprise policy method; however, this disables updates for all profiles using the same program/install directory.  Obviously I like to keep up to date, so this is no good.
</p><p>I don't want to have to have a seprate program/install dir for each profile -- then I would just have to update them all separately anyway.

</p><p>Me gustaria hacer que firefox solo puediese acceder a una única página web. La cosa es que no quiero utilizar complementos ya que el usuario puede desactivarlos o borrarlos.
</p><p>¿Hay alguna forma, mediante archivos de configuracion, de conseguir esto (una especie de Whitelist)? He visto el fichero Host de Windows, pero solo me deja bloquear sitios. ¿Se puede bloquear al usuario para que no pueda modificar nada de los complementos ya instalados?

</p><p>Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it.  The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.
