Nos, using Firefox, I cannot download the ""emoticons"" feature of my Xfinity e mail. They won't download.
After talking to Comcast, I switched to Chrome and was able to fully download the emoticons. 
I would like to continue using Firefox, but can you please fix my ""emoticon"" problem?

</p><p>Starting with FF 69, there is no way to allow Flash to run without being authorized for EVERY site, EVERY time one visits it.  The developers have cited the fact that Flash itself will be discontinued by Adobe at the end of 2020 as justification for this.  That is still over a year away and I see this move as very premature AND very user-UNfriendly.
</p><p>It has been less than a month since FF 69 and I am already tired of having to authorize the plugin every day on the three remaining sites (that I visit daily) which still require Flash because they have not upgraded to HTML5.  While I understand completely that this is an industry-wide matter -- that Adobe itself will discontinue support for Flash -- Firefox's developers have made the (IMHO) absurd decision to inconvenience users more than a year before this move became necessary.
</p><p>What I would like to see is, when the pull-down menu from the ""Lego block"" displays, is an option under ""Allow"" to let the user designate ""Always allow for this site"".  Once coded, it would never need to be removed, because as sites do convert to HTML5 there would no longer be a ""trigger"" for the Flash plugin.
</p><p>PLEASE, those of you developers who made the change in FF 69, do not perpetuate the image we all have of you as being heavy-handed and uncaring about Firefox users.  Make our lives easier while we wait for our favorite sites to upgrade.  Let us allow Flash to run, only on our specific sites, without a daily inconvenience.
</p><p>Admit you ""jumped the gun"" and do the right thing by us.

I changed my primary email address at a time, when Firefox Sync did not support changing email addresses.
I now checked to see if changing email addresses was possible and indeed, you can now add a secondary email address and switch it to be the primary one. So I tries to add my current email address as a secondary, but it fails with ""This email was already verified by another user"". I thought that maybe I had created an additional Firefox Sync account with the new email address and tried to log in with it, but that fails with ""Primary account email required for sign-in"".
I am not aware of any other account and I checked my mailboxes (including the trash) to see if I have any registration or account change emails, but I cannot find anything. And given that fact, that I changed the email address before secondary emails were I think I also cannot see how it would even be possible.
</p><p>Is there anyway to find the primary email address (or the account) using only a secondary email address?
</p><p>If that is not possible, I'd like to have the secondary email address removed from whatever account it is attached to. I can proof I'm the only owner of that address. Would that be possible?

After I click on Firefox icon I can see two firefox processes in task manager, but after some time they just quit, without showing any window or even error message. I tried to enter safe mode by pressing ""shift"" while starting firefox - no result, processes quit before even showing dialog about entering safe mode. I tried to uninstall &amp; install firefox back - still the same result. I removed profiles in ""cd %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\"" - still the same. There are two records in windows logs upon each start attempt:

Apart from downgrading or reverting to another browser that has not implemented this ridiculous anti-user-friendiness measure, what can I do?
