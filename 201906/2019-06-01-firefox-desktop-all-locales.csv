My system was just purchased brand new in Feb. This message did not display when I dl either browser. I've NEVER downloaded ANY Avast or anything like it, I use Windows Defender and that's it. I'm not a techie - but I'm like really neurotic over hard drive space - I don't download ANYTHING unless I absolutely HAVE to with the exception of browsers. I only download those from their official websites though.  I do play some games, I've only downloaded games from Steam, Origin, and Utomik. I do have all of their clients on my PC. Other than that, there's been NOTHING I've dl.  I only included that info because I thought it might help.  Can someone PLEASE help with this. I tried to look at the registry, I'm not seeing anything that seems amiss but I need more specifics - I've read the other questions and answers on this - but I don't know HOW to change anything to see if it helps.

I also did the procedure suggested to make an HTML file from the backup file, just in case I might need it, but I do not see the HTML file in 'documents'.  Is it somewhere else?  I could list some of the efforts I have made to get my bookmarks back but it would take several pages of typing.  Right now I have about 15 windows open from links on help pages for multiple ways to fix bookmarks problems, but after working on this for several hours I am hopelessly confused.

More detail
For several years I’ve been running backup every night without problems.  Recently – over perhaps the last couple of months – the files in firefox\ storage\default, together with my backup path details, give path lengths that exceeded the Windows 10 limit and give errors in my backup.  I don’t use the default location for firefox files.  I've solved this by shortening the paths to my firefox file location.

</p><p>The curious thing is that this bug is *old*. Like, *old* old. It's actually one of the reasons I originally switched away from Firefox about six or seven years ago, which is why I'm so surprised that it's still around and that nobody is talking about it, according to a quick Google search.
</p><p>Add-ons, cache, or similar things can't be the problem, because this is essentially a reinstall of Firefox.
</p><p>I hope you can figure this one out. As you can imagine, having to restart the computer every once in a while after dragging a tab from one window to a new one is not really realistic long-term.

</p><p>If you take that long word put in a .html, and render, for me shows small gaps after groups of 9, 14, 18, 20... characters. The number of characters may change in different tags, like tables or a div, but always show small gaps. Tested in chromiun, but just works fine, without this gaps.
</p><p>In online text editor does not show, but when rendered is shows.
</p><p>Another detail, you need a css to force the word to break. And when this lines are created by the brake is when the gaps are visible. The css code used in that flow:
</p><p><br>
tag {
word-break: break-word;     //1 For chromiun
word-wrap: break-word;      //2 For chromiun
overflow-wrap: anywhere;   //3 For Firefox
}
