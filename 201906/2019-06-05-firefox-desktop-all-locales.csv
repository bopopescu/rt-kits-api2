A felső 1/3 hiányzik....alul meg 1/3 fehér üres rész van.  Az az érdekes, hogy HA növelem a nagyítást akkor 300%-nál előbukkannak a hiányzó részek, de értelemszerűen már összevissza törve. Ezen nagyítás alatt..le egészen a minimum 30%-ig hiányzik. Chrome alatt tökéletes.
Próbáltam:
-rókás téma kikapcsolást
-gyorsítótár törlést
-nagyítás módosítást (valami itt kergülhetett meg)
-süti törlés
Más weboldalon/webes felületen nincs gondom.

</p><p>As an aside, it is very difficult to find some way to contact Mozilla.  You list Facebook as a way to contact you, but that is no longer being used.  There seems to be no way to, easily, get in contact with Mozilla.  It is as if Mozilla wants to make it as difficult as possible for people to bring their concerns to them.

Meanwhile, those same websites work fine in Quantum versions in Sierra. And I can successfully delete suggestions. It's the same browser version with the same add-ons and extensions, so why does it work so inconsistently? Or could the one on Yosemite be corrupt (for some unknown reason that an upgrade isn't fixing), and I just need to rebuild it (although I don't want to lose my profile if I don't have to)?
