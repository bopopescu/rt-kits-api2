1260925,1559593755,1559593755,Dropdown Menus Not Working Properly Firefox 67...,"<p>This has been a continual problem since Firefox 56 or 57. There have been no suggestions that have worked to correct this issue. If someone wants to check this out for themselves, log into eBay and start the process to list an item. When you see all of the drop down menus to select different things (like the item condition, etc.), you will find that the menus will NOT stay open (you have to click and hold the left mouse button to make your selection).  I noticed that the drop down menus on this site won't function correctly, either.
</p><p>This is occurring with two bluetooth mice and a USB mouse as well. The operating system is MacOS 10.14.3. The problem does not occur in the versions of Firefox prior to 56 or 57 and the problem does not occur in Chrome.
</p><p>One thing I just discovered is that if I click at the very outside edge of the menus, they will usually stay open. I really would like to get this issue solved once and for all. Refreshing the browser does not change anything and neither does safe mode. I think there is some coding change within Firefox that is causing the issue.
</p><p>If anyone has any idea as to what might be causing this issue, please respond. Thanks in advance. 
</p><p>P.S.  It was suggested that I try a test profile or a new load.  I have just finished a completely fresh load of OS 10.14.3 on a brand new SSD.  NONE of my Firefox profile information was transferred (only my bookmarks).  I transferred NONE of my computer user profile information, either - I installed everything from scratch and manually transferred all of my documents, photos, music, movies, etc.  The problem is STILL happening on a completely fresh build of my OS.

I can disable or remove them. I can re-download and add them without error.  But-neither show the icon on top, nor do they work.  This does not appear to be the issue that occurred on 4 May.  I'm stumped. When I check browser integration in Roboform, there are none listed, meaning that Roboform has not been integrated with FF, but add ons in FF show that it is and it is enabled.  Nothing to check on add block plus, but there is no icon, so it is not doing anything. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

</p><p>I have just installed Linux Mint 19 alongside Windows 7, and installed Linux Firefox 67.  Windows also has 67.
I pointed the Linux Firefox to the Windows Profile file, and it looked exactly like the Windows version.
When I went to access websites that have stored login names and password, the Login names were there, but the passwords did not show.   When I entered a password again, and asked it to Save, it proceeded and logged in.   When I logged off, and tried to login again, the Login name was there, but no password - had to enter it again.
I have looked through all of the relevant posts in Support, and tried several options, but none work.  Would appreciate some assistance is solving this one please.   Thanks    plml

About a week ago, when I click on a button or link in a web page, it no longer opens a new tab.  Instead, a small window briefly pops up and is then snuffed out a second later.  Changing the settings to open a new window rather than a new tab has not helped.  I have not added any new pop-up blockers or antivirus programs, and I did not change any settings in my current ones.  I have tried all of the steps suggested by users in the knowledge base, but without effect.  Can you help?
