Recently with the update to 67, periodically when I launch the browser it will just show a blank white page and the address bar just says ""search with Google or enter address.""  I can hit the home button and it takes me to my home page.  Other times when I launch Firefox it works without issue and takes me directly to my home page.  I have browser.startup.blankWindow set to ""false"" in ""about:config,""  but issue still randomly occurs.  Again, this is multiple computers and multiple OSes all encountering this issue.  Yes, some have some add-ons/extensions, but others do not and there doesn't seem to be any pattern that I can discern.  Anyone else encountering this? Any fix short of uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox.  Worked just fine up through 66 (would prefer not to revert back).

I am in the process of slowly migrating to a more user friendly browser (Vivaldi), but before I change default browsers I thought I'd try one more time and ask if there is any way to restore the ability to keep a few tabs open in Firefox while browsing.  Thanks for any help.

Sometimes i can goto system menu and switch to my monitors speakers and then back to the 5.1 surround system i have and it will fix it. Now that fix doesnt work, the only way to get audio back is to shut down firefox and restart it. Sometimes starting firefox it tells me firefox is still running do i want to shut it down? I do shut it down and the audio comes back. THis has been this way for a wile and i have been testing different things on my system but every thing is pointing to firefox. Internet explorer/edge/chrome has no audio issues at all.
</p><pre>To explain a little more on what i mean , I can play a video on youtube or netflix/vudu etc etc and audio sounds good lots of bass treble highs lows and then it goes flat. NO bass/treble/highs/lows etc.
</pre>
<pre>what is odd also is my default speakers are set to my 5.1 surround sound and it will get changed to either my monitor speakers or a digital out port which i dont have anything hooked to. It is like firefox coding is getting confused on which set of speakers to play audio to and eventually gives up and settles for a default driver setting?

I've noticed a very odd behaviour with Firefox Monitor (FM), which I started using today: 
I 've created my Firefox account quite some time ago using my email address SchmidtSt@web.de (written with 2 upper case ""S"") as User-ID. When I signed up for FM today, it told me ""0 breaches"" which I found odd since I know for sure from <a href=""http://haveIbeenpwned.com"" rel=""nofollow"">haveIbeenpwned.com</a> that this email address had been breached on <a href=""http://last.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">last.fm</a> (and 3 further ""unverified"" breaches).
</p><p>So I added another email address I'm using, Schmidt_St@hotmail.com (again, out of habit) written with 2 upper case ""S"". And again, to my surprise: ""0 breaches"" -Â ?!? That one, too, had been breached on <a href=""http://last.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">last.fm</a>, and additionally on <a href=""http://Verifications.io"" rel=""nofollow"">Verifications.io</a>.
</p><p>Thus I tried adding these two email addresses written in lower case only - and guess what? Now it works ...
</p><p>I think you should fix this, since the UI of <a href=""http://haveIbeenpwned.com"" rel=""nofollow"">haveIbeenpwned.com</a> has no problem with using upper case letters in email addresses (and for email addresses it usually makes no difference if you write them lower or upper case).
</p><p>Cheers and best regards,
Steffen Schmidt.

Firefox was closed as part of the process.
I now only have some 25 tabs compared to the 100+ i had open.
I tried to find the previous session file but that seems to be deleted, rename or relocated.
Is my previous session gone forever?
Thanks in advance.

1261066,1559787847,1559793063,how do I get LastPass and AdBlock to work after version 67 update?,"<p>My other computer uses Win7 and every time Firefox updates, I loose LastPass and AdBlock+. I have to open 'add-ons', click 'disable', then click 'enable' and close and reopen Firefox. today I open Firefox, it tells me all about the wonderfulness of version 67, but the add-ons are marked as 'Legacy'. When I click to get more info, it shows nothing and I have to click 'extensions' again. If I click 'disable' and close the browser, the next time it shows a button to 'enable'. But clicking and restarting the browser does no good.
I tried to get help, but without LastPass, which Mozilla recommends, I can't even ask the questions.

</p><p>I'm running latest version of FF Quantum (67.0.1 (64-bit)) on my Mac (macOS Mojave, version 10.14.5).
I've enabled Bookmarks under Highlights in the Home page settings. Any time I add a new bookmark it shows up in the highlights. But my problem is when ever I clear my browser history the Highlights doesn't show any bookmarks even though bookmarks are there under the Bookmarks toolbar.
