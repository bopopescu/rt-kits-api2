I lost Adblock plus, I managed to reinstall and lost all my settings that I can't recover. Years of settings gone. All other apps as far as I can tell are still installed so why did adblock get deleted with all the settings?

</p><p>As of yesterday, June 3rd, the game simply will not load.
Already tried clearing the cache, no good.  Upgraded flash, nope.
They suggested another browser.   I  have opera so tried, and it works just fine.
I don't  use opera.   Don't really want to either.  One browser is fine.
</p><p>They finally admitted they just did a game upgrade and suddenly now firefox won't work?
Sounds to me like this browser has an issue, not their game.   Since it works on another browser.
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm on version 64 and please DO NOT tell me to upgrade.   The next version will AUTO upgrade without my knowledge or permission.   VERY BAD AND STUPID IDEA TO FORCE THINGS ONTO PEOPLE!   
Let ME decide when, why, and IF I need an upgrade.    NOT YOU!    Hoping when you come out with the next version you LISTEN TO PEOPLE and stop forcing upgrades.   Bad enough I have to click ""not now"" every damn time I launch this thing.   STOP IT!!!!  This has been said by MANY PEOPLE too.   LISTEN!  STOP IT!
So an upgrade isn't happening.    If I have to I'll simply switch to opera.
Really don't want to do that.
</p><p>Hoping you can figure out why this simple game site suddenly stopped loading.   
</p><p>I will forward this post to the support person I've been talking with.    MAYBE you two can get together and figure out what went glitchy?

</p><p>I'm using Firefox on a couple of Macs and Windows 10 machines for quite some time now. And I keep tabs and bookmarks in sync with Firefox Sync. Has been working great for quite some time.
</p><p>Since somewhere last week, it started giving me headaches. It started with requiring me to log into sync again on one of the machines (can't quite remember wether it was Win10 or Mac). My password (complex 35 characters, managed by LastPass password manager) did not work. Que? OK, so I reset the password with a recovery key (2FA enabled) and was able to log in again.
</p><p>Then another machine gave me exactly the same: log in again, password wrong, only way in was to reset password, etc.
</p><p>It seems I can get either all macOS Firefoxes to sync -or- the Win10 Firefoxes to sync, but not both. I tried completely starting over with sync (deleting my account, setting it up from scratch). But still the same problem...
</p><p>I'm at my wits end with this... Anyone else having this problem? Was not able to find a reference on google or the support forums ;-(.
</p><p>I guess it started with Firefox 67.0 (which has an update as I check just now).
</p><p>Any hints or help most welcome :-D

Let's say I wanted to use the first search engine: I had to press  ctrl+up arrow until I select the first search engine. Pressing again ctrl+up arrow did not change the search engine.
</p><p>This was useful because to select quickly the first search engine I didn't have to focus and read the search engine field: I just had to see when the search engine field didn't change upon subsequent ctrl+up arrow key stroke.
(The same happened with the last search engine using ctrl+down arrow)
</p><p>Now, if the first  search engine is selected, pressing ctrl+up arrow select the last search engine, so I cannot quickly select the first (or last)  search engine without focusing on the search field.
</p><p>Is there a way, apart from adding a keyword to a search engine, for quickly selecting a specific search engine in the search bar?

Can you clean my Sync?","<p>Was using Lubuntu for years on old hardware, then OS got corrupted.  Chgd Distro to ""AntiX"" which worked for a few weeks, then FF quit loading Tags (blue dot just goes back &amp; forth but no load).  Bought a new computer meantime but would like to keep old stuff running and most of all clean out the anti-captialist propaganda garbage than landed in my FF synch account, including loops.  An add-in that kills loops and moves all bookmarks to the bookmarks bar would be helpful.  Presumably it was 'AntiX' that put the propaganda in my FF bookmarks, but bookmarks, if a directed graph, seems susceptible to loops and should have defenses against loops so once garbage like Anti-X's gets in, it can be cleaned out.  Cryptically, my FF account asked me today to verify my home country  (!) -- which I did (USA).  Help appreciated, but if too much trouble would like Synch account destroyed so I can start a new one with same email.  Also years and years and years ago I had an early Synch account with the same email address, so if it's calusing trouble, it can all be wiped out.  Having to write this from some other browser on a new computer.  Thanks!

But after the latest update to Firefox about two weeks ago (now version 67.0), Firefox only loads 10 tabs of the previous session, instead of all of them like it used to. I need about 30 tabs for work, so this feature made it very convenient. Any suggestions?
Thank you.
